<p class="noindent">It is hoped that the readers of the following chapters will bear in
mind the fact that this is the first complete account of Gaelic
literature that has yet been offered to the public, and that it must
inevitably exhibit traces of the natural imperfections of all pioneer
works. To other workers in the same field I am of course greatly
indebted; and if any of them had published a fairly full history of
our Highland literature it is quite unlikely that the present
volume would ever see the light.</p>

<p>The names of about one hundred and eighty composers of
Gaelic poetry alone occur in this volume, while not more than a
third of that number will be found in any previous work on the
subject. Still I am aware that some mistakes and omissions will
be met with, but these, I trust, will not elicit so much reprehension
as material for correction hereafter.</p>

<p>On the subject of the science of language and race movements
glanced at in the Introduction, the student will find the latest
views in the works of Penka, Schrader, Sayce, Hyde Clarke, and
others. The “Ultonian Hero-Ballads” of Mr Hector MacLean
and the <cite lang="la">Reliquæ Celticæ</cite> of the late Dr Alexander Cameron will
be prized by those interested in the fields on which the great Cuchulin
fought and Ossian sang.</p>

<p>My studies in the Celtic field have been carried on in the midst
of duties of a sacred and exacting character; and I have often
been hindered by the thought that the attraction in this direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
ought to be resisted. Still I have felt like many others the need
of making a speciality of some helpful study; and what for me
could be more natural as a mental exercise than to be found
searching out in those obscure fields of an ancient literature for
the intellectual products of my forefathers?</p>

<p>I am much indebted to several friends who encouraged me from
time to time. It gives me great pleasure to mention among these
the name of Dr Stoddart, late editor of <cite>The Glasgow Herald</cite>
whose kindness and generosity to myself personally I will always
cherish with gratitude, and whose sympathies with all that is
good and noble in any people were the natural outcome of the
cultured heart of a gentleman and a Christian. To him I owe the
title of this book as well as the privilege, through the columns of his
influential journal, of showing some of the treasures of our Gaelic
literature to the great English world beyond our Highland Israel.
With his name ought to be associated in this matter that of the
able manager of the paper, Mr Alexander Sinclair, an Argyleshire
Highlander. The articles then published in 1881 were the first of
the kind to appear in a newspaper of such high standing. The
names of other gentlemen from whom I have received kindness
occur to me also as I write: Mr D. H. Macfarlane, ex-M.P.;
Mr Fraser-Mackintosh, M.P.; Dr R. Macdonald, M.P.; Mr
Duncan Macneill; and Mr John Mackay, C.E. I have also much
pleasure in acknowledging the readiness with which the Messrs
Nisbet, publishers, London, have granted me permission to use in
the following chapters some articles I contributed to <cite>The Catholic
Presbyterian</cite>.</p>

<p>This book may be described as the child of the peaceful Highland
revolution on which the political and Christian genius of
the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone stamped imperial sanction and
approval in the Crofters Act of 1886. Its growth and delivery in
various lectures, magazine articles and otherwise, during seventeen
years, have been coincident with the workings of the spirit of
racial fusion and union which recent political struggles after a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
Brito-Irish brotherhood have well-nigh perfected. On the following
pages, therefore, I am occasionally an advocate of the just
rights and claims of a noble race and an obscure literature; but
at the same time I remain a lover of the great English people. I
have learned during a residence of upwards of ten years to appreciate
and love the generous qualities of my English fellow-citizens.</p>

<p lang="gd">“Forchubus caichduini imbia arrath inlebrán colli aratardda bendacht
foranmain intruagáin rodscribai.”</p>

<p class="right"><em>Gaelic (Scot.) MS. of 9th Cent.</em></p>
</div>


<p>The Celts and the Teuton started westward from the cradle of
the human race, spreading themselves over Europe; while other
members of the same stock went eastward, extending themselves
over wide tracts of Asia. From the Celts, the Greeks, the Romans,
and the Teutons have sprung the chief nations in whose possession
Europe still remains. It is interesting to think that the brothers
who parted thousands of years ago, somewhere in teeming Asia, the
one going east and the other west, are now meeting again on the
plains of Hindostan. Their movements during those thousands of
years have encircled the whole earth. Fiercely have they fought
and disputed over every inch of the ground which one or other of
their tribes at one time or other occupied. Theirs has always
been the chief ruling power in the world. They begin to know
one another again. From the extreme west of Europe, across the
New World, the Anglo-Celt arrives in India and recognises the
Hindoo as his brother.</p>

<p>The Aryans migrated into Europe in a somewhat advanced
state of civilisation. According to Sayce their advent was from
the north, a theory which subverts nearly all previously accepted
opinions on the subject. Some of them, however, such as the
Greeks first and the Romans afterwards, favoured by the maritime
countries in which they settled, made more rapid progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
than the others. It was largely their self-conceit that led the
Greeks and Romans to describe all the nations beyond their bounds
as “barbarian.” Our ancestors in these islands, whether Celtic
or Teutonic, were never mere savages. They had a religion, if
not radically the same, fully as enobling in its tendency as that of
Greece and Rome. They evidently made some progress in the
useful arts, while in the days of Rome’s greatest splendour they
were in possession of military weapons which were not much inferior
to her own. The form of government among the Celts was
patriarchal, and this continued for a long time among the Gaels of
Scotland. There was the king or chief, who was regarded as the
father of the clan, tribe, or nation. With him was associated a
council of chieftains or elders, and in important matters the mot of
the whole people. But with all this political organisation they
could not make such progress in civilisation as the Greeks and
Romans, who mostly dwelt in cities. The Gaels who along with
the Germans acted the part of pioneers on the plains of Europe,
and living a rural life, could not compete successfully in the race
for higher civilisation with the brother races who inhabited the
maritime cities of Greece and Italy, and who, besides, obtained
much of an earlier civilisation from Phœnicia and Egypt.</p>

<p>The early migrations of the Gael are involved in much obscurity.
By the study of topography, however, we can follow many of his
footsteps westward. This study, however, is rendered very difficult,
and at times very uncertain, because the discoverable traces
of the presence of the Celt lie embedded in the soil of the life of
the powerful pre-Celtic races. The Celt and the Teuton have
always been close neighbours. The progress of the two westward
appears to have been somewhat simultaneous, at least on the
Continent. The geographical positions of France and Germany
at the present day represent not inaccurately the attitude of the
Gaelic and Teutonic races towards one another in their earlier
movements from the east. It has been said that the Celts came
too soon into Europe, just as the Slaves came too late. It would
be difficult to verify this remark in the light of history and in the
face of existing facts. While admitting that the remark may have
an element of truth in it, we must remember, with regard to the
Slaves, that it is premature to anticipate what they may become.
We see them a mighty threatening wave on a westward course.
The Chinese hordes, who are already a trouble, press behind the
Russians; and the growing power of the latter in Europe is a
matter of serious concern to our statesmen. The struggle between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Celt and Teuton again cannot be said to be at an end as long as
France and Germany maintain their present watchful and hostile
attitude. As to their racial composition respectively the former
may be said to be as much Celtic as the latter is Teutonic. But
on the other hand, in the United Kingdom, Celt and Teuton may
be said virtually to agree. They have so blended for centuries
that, notwithstanding boasts on both sides, which science cannot
sustain, it is impossible almost to produce a pure Saxon or a pure
Gael. It cannot certainly be done in Scotland. This intermingling
of races in the British Islands has produced a national character
very unlike our Continental neighbours. The Anglo-Celtic power
of the British Empire is not so immobile or sluggish as the German,
nor so light and airy as the French; and its rule appears
almost to have arrived at the incipient stage of universal dominion.</p>

<p>Great Britain was peopled in the north and in the south simultaneously
from the Continent, and Ireland was similarly peopled
from the north and south of Britain. The Gaels of Ireland and
of Scotland were the same people, having the same language and
music; and all the elements of civilisation about them were the
common property of both. At the same time there are evidences
that the Gaels of the North of Ireland stood in closer relationship
to those of Scotland than those in the South of Ireland. And
this holds true even to this very day. It should always be borne
in mind that there have been different tribes of pre-Celts, Celts and
Teutons in Ireland, which has hitherto prevented that national
cohesion in the time of danger which alone could secure the independence
of the country. Ireland being peopled at a later period,
has taken a longer time in developing a full-orbed nationality.
On the other hand there has been an earlier homogeneity among
the Scottish Celts; whether called Picts, Gaels, Scots, or Albanaich,
they were always one against the common foe, whatever
might be the feuds among themselves. In more recent days the
reformation of religion in the 16th century helped to produce in
the Scottish Gael a distinctively different character from that of
the Gael of Ireland; it also destroyed in Scotland many of the
old Gaelic things which were associated with a religion that was
regarded as superstitious. Thus much of the history and the
literature of the Scottish Gael was lost. In Ireland, where no
violent changes took place in the condition and religious beliefs of
the people, we find very extensive manuscript literature—rich with
interesting spoils of the past—as well as more relics even of earlier
Gaelic life in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Chiefly through the great labours of Zeuss, the distinguished
Bavarian, the Gael is now, as already remarked, universally admitted
to belong to the Aryan family. No student of the science
of language will now contend that he has any special affinity to the
Semitic race. The <em>Keltae</em> of the Greek, the <em>Galli</em> of the Roman,
and the <em lang="gd">Gàidheil</em> of Scotland and Ireland, are the same people.
In the east and in the west <em>Galatia</em>, or in Gaelic [<em lang="gd">Gaidhealtachd</em>,
contracted] and pronounced <em lang="gd">Gaeltachd</em>, is the <em>Celtica</em>, or land of
the Celts or Gaels. <em lang="gd">Gaeltachd</em> or <em>Galatia</em> is literally Gael<em>dom</em>, or
the country of the <em>Gaels</em>. The term “Gael” is the same as
“Celt,” the only difference being that the original <em>Gaidel</em> comes
to us through Latin in the former and through Greek in the latter.
So the two may be used indiscriminately, although some writers
have endeavoured to preserve a distinction, using “Gaelic” for the
language spoken in Scotland and Ireland, and “Celtic” as a more
generic term, embracing all the Gaelic Brythonic dialects. “Gael”—the
Roman “Gaul”—and the original “<span lang="gd">Gaidel</span>,” aspirated into
“<span lang="gd">Gaidhel</span>,” which in its aspirated form at last drops the <em>dh</em>, and
becomes “Gael” or Gaul, is just the same word. The Gael stands
in the same relation to the Welsh, the Cornishman, and the
Armorican, that the Englishman and German, the Roman and
Greek, stand to one another. The Gael, the Manx, and the Irish
constitute one branch of the stock, while the Welsh, the Cornish,
and the Breton constitute the other.</p>

<p>The Celtic element enters largely into the population of the
United Kingdom. Just as Celtic dialects were spoken at one time
throughout the whole of the British Islands, so to the present day
a powerful Celtic element pervades the people of Great Britain
and Ireland from the lowest to the highest classes. John Knox
and Robert Burns, two representative Scotchmen, were more Celtic
than Teutonic. The national perfervid spirit and genius are so still.
The name of the great Reformer is from the Gaelic <i lang="gd">Cnoc</i>.
Ireland can produce many Anglo-Celtic names, among which we
find that of the Duke of Wellington. The mothers of the greatest
epic poet and the greatest general that England ever produced
were Celts. Sarah Caston, the mother of Milton, was the daughter
of a Welsh gentleman; and Elizabeth Steward, the mother of
Cromwell, was the daughter of William Steward, in Ely, a descendant
of the Celtic Stewards of Scotland. Professor H. Morley
says:—“The main current of English literature cannot be disconnected
from the lively Celtic wit in which it has one of its sources.
The Celts do not form an utterly distinct part of our mixed population.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
But for early, frequent, and various contact with the race
that, in its half-barbarous days, invented Ossian’s dialogues with
St. Patrick, and that quickened afterwards the Northerner’s blood
in France. Germanic England would not have produced a Shakespeare.”
It is only the other year that a Cambrian Celt disappeared
from our midst—one of the greatest names in English literature—Mary
A. Evans, better known by her assumed name of George
Eliot. This other quotation from Professor Morley’s “Library of
English Literature” is as true as it is suggestive:—“The Celts are
by nature artists. Mr Ferguson has felt this in his own art, and
said in his ‘History of Architecture:’—‘The true glory of the
Celt in Europe is his artistic eminence. It is, perhaps, not too
much to assert that without his intervention we should not have
possessed in modern times a Church worthy of admiration or a
picture or a statue we could look at without shame.’ It would be
far too much to assert this of books; but certainly Teutonic England
could not have risen to the full grandeur and beauty of that
expression of all her life in all her literature ... without a
wholesome blending of Teutonic with Celtic blood. The Celts
are a vital part of our country, and theirs were the first songs in
the land.”</p>

<p>Before parting with this subject let me note three remarkable
facts which the history of Gaelic Scotland presents. They have
not always been fully recognised. The first is that the Caledonians
were never fully conquered by the Roman Power which brought
almost all other nations of the world into subjection. The second
is that a Gaelic people gave its present name to the country. The
third is that a Gaelic King has given us the line of monarchs which
we have still represented in the present sovereign of the British
Empire. To these another fact might be added—that the earliest
modern literature is to be found among the Scoto-Irish Gael.
After the decadence of Greece and Rome the Celts were the first
of the European tribes to cultivate letters. While the Germans
and the Northmen were yet roving heathen tribes the Gael in Ireland
and in Scotland had their seminaries of learning, where
literature was loved and cherished. And from the Colleges of
Durrow and Iona missionaries, whose well-trained minds and
zealous hearts fitted them for their great undertaking, went forth
to Christianise the people of England and the Teutonic tribes on
the Continent. The extant manuscripts in Gaelic and Latin which
came from their pens are monuments of their learning and piety,
as well as of the reverence in which they were held by the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
to whom they brought the light of the Christian truth. Some of
these manuscripts, now studied with such rich results by Continental
Celtic scholars, are to be found in some of the great libraries
on the Continent; in St. Gall, Milan, Wurtzburg, and Carlsruhe,
Zeuss found those Gaelic ones on which he based his great work
the “Grammatica Celtica,” published in 1853. These facts ought
to make the study of Gaelic interesting—the oldest living language
in Europe that can boast of such early relics of culture.</p>

<p>It is now necessary that some remarks should be made on the
language in which the literature we are to examine is to be found.
The Celtic forms a branch of the Indo-European group of languages.
It is divided into two nearly distinct languages, which are
thus <span class="nowrap">classified:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The differences between Gaelic, Irish, and Manx are merely dialectic.
The Cornish became extinct last century. The Gaulish is
also extinct; and what remains of it is found only in the names of
places.</p>

<p>To Zeuss is due the credit of having assigned its proper place
to Celtic in the family of languages. The problem before his great
publication in 1853 was the relationship in which the Gaels, the
Welsh, and the old Gaulish people stood to one another and to
the other nations of the world. Numerous publications on this
question appeared during the last two centuries. But from a
scientific point of view they are of very little value. Errors and
unscientific theories abound in every work. At that time the
scholars of France and Germany never mastered the Celtic languages;
indeed, there were few reliable grammars by which they
could be acquired. The native scholars were deficient in linguistic
training, in common sense, and frequently in common honesty.
No Gaelic scholar was conscientious enough to learn Welsh, no
Welsh scholar to learn Gaelic; but each and all were ready enough
to compare their languages with Phœnician, Persian, Etruscan,
Egyptian, Hebrew, Arabic, &amp;c., of which, again, they knew in
reality next to nothing; though a few of them might know a little
Hebrew. There was one remarkable exception, however, to this—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
great Welsh scholar Edward Llhuyd, of whom it may be said
that he lived a century and a half before his time; but, incapable
of following him, the native school of philologists sank into chaotic
and puerile etymological dreams. The Celtic problem became
more hopeless than ever, and Gaelic philology became distasteful
to sober minds.</p>

<p>At the same time many Celts insisted “on the lofty claim they
used to advance of speaking the primeval language.” It is only
recently that they have learned “to submit to the logic of facts
and listen to the voice of science.” A Gaelic poet, in an elaborate
poem on his native language, thus declares his conviction on the
much-debated subject, what language was spoken in <span class="nowrap">Paradise—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“By Adam it was spoken</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In Eden, I believe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sweetly flowed the Gaelic</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From the lovely lips of Eve.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Some fifty years ago the science of comparative philology began
to make itself felt, and Celtic scholars tried to apply its principles
to Celtic. Pritchard, Bopp, Diefenbach, Pictet, and others worked
in the right direction, but they failed fully to solve the Celtic problem.
J. Caspar Zeuss, a Bavarian Highlander, at last succeeded,
by combining with a mind of unusual power a devotion to the
subject which amounted well-nigh to a sacrifice of his life. This
devotion might not even have been sufficient if he had not possessed
what no one before him possessed—the really oldest
manuscripts of both the Irish and Welsh dialects. The labours of
Zeuss have shown:—That the Gaelic and Welsh languages were
originally one; that dialectic differences in Cæsar’s time were
so small that an old Gael would be at once understood in Wales;
and that the Gaels and Cambrians were identical with the Celts of
the Continent—with those of Spain, Gaul, Lombardy, and the
Alpine countries; that this Celtic tongue is one of the branches of
the Aryan stock of languages.</p>

<p>The consequence of these established facts is to put an end to
all attempts at connecting the Celtic with the Semitic class of
tongues.</p>

<p>We know the Gaelic language now in three <span class="nowrap">stages:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Old Gaelic up to 1000 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> The most ancient relics of this period
are the glosses of St. Gall in Switzerland, the Ambrosian <a id="tn-7">Library of Milan</a>,
&amp;c., discovered by Zeuss.</p>

<p>2. Middle Gaelic, from 1000-1500 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, is represented by an extensive
mass of manuscript literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>3. Modern Gaelic from the sixteenth century, when books began to be
printed, to the present day.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The softening caused by excessive aspiration is the greatest change
which the language has undergone.</p>

<p>As spoken in Scotland at the present day the chief dialectic
differences <span class="nowrap">are:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The <em>ia</em> of the North for the <em>eu</em> of the South and West Highlands,
illustrated by <span class="smcap">Bial</span>, <span class="smcap">Beul</span>, <em>mouth</em>; <span class="smcap">Fiar</span>, <span class="smcap">Feur</span>, <em>grass</em>.</p>

<p>2. The vowel-tone difference, illustrated in such words as <span class="smcap">Oran</span>, song.
The <em>o</em> is pronounced in three different ways; in Islay and other parts of
Argyll like <em>o</em> in <em>old</em>; in Mull and other place like <em>ou</em> in <em>foul</em>; in the North
generally like <em>aw</em> in <em>law</em>.</p>

<p>3. The consonantal difference illustrated <a id="tn-8">in the pronunciation</a> of <em>c</em> and
<em>chd</em>.</p>

<p>4. The accentual or rhythmic tone difference, observed in the conversation
of natives of different places.</p>
</div>

<p>In Arran and Perthshire, and to some extent in Caithness and
Sutherland, the people in speaking cut off the terminal syllables of
many words. In the North Highlands they speak with a slow,
sometimes swinging emphasis; in the South Highlands they are
more hurried in their utterance. Any Highlander, speaking
distinctly, will be readily understood, North and South.</p>

<p>Gaelic appears to possess wonderful vitality. While English
has stamped out Gaelic among the Celts of Galloway and Ayrshire,
Gaelic has stamped out the Norse language in the Western Isles,
where the people are largely of pre-Celtic and Norse origin. It
is remarkable that although of the same family of languages, Gaelic
and English, like oil and water, cannot readily commingle.</p>

<p>Other subjects associated with early Gaelic literature are the Druids
and the Féinne. That dim, indefinite, prehistoric period of our
annals which terminated in the contact of heathenism with the
living forces of Christianity may be termed pre-Celtic. In the
dawn of the historical period a mysterious class of men called
Druids, and a mysterious body of heroes called the Féinne or
Fianna, emerge into view, just as we mark the vanishing or absorption
of the pre-Celtic peoples. Whatever they were, a certain
class of <em>Magi</em> existed once in these islands. But their sudden
disappearance in history, like that of the Féinne, has induced
many to question whether such an order of men ever lived. But
it is historically certain that a class of men, answering to the description,
met and tried to oppose Columba from Iona when he
visited King Brudeus at Inverness. They have been called Druids,
but that term should be regarded in a general or conventional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
sense. They were without doubt the priests of learning and religion
among the ancient Scots. In possession of some knowledge,
meagre as it probably was, they were invested with mystic importance
by the ignorant and superstitious. With the introduction
and enlightenment of Christianity it would be seen that this
exclusive order and priestly caste found their supremacy undermined.
Their teaching, whatever it was, appears to have had a
beneficial influence on the formation of the national character.
They do not seem to have indulged in any enervating services or
gross idolatry in the kind of worship which was maintained among
the people. We see the moral significance of their influence more
fully when we contrast the ancient Gaels with the ancient Greeks.
With all their fine ethical and æsthetic perceptions, we find
that the latter throughout their whole history were never a very
moral people. Just as their bodily senses were enslaved by their
keen sense of the beautiful in form, colour, &amp;c., so were their moral
energies by many vices. The sensual and luxurious life of the
Romans also soon sapped the foundations of the empire, and made
it a prey to the less civilised nations around. But from the earliest
times down to the present we find among the people once influenced
by the Druids a very high moral tone. Guilty as they might
be of plundering other races with whom they openly waged warfare,
strict honesty among themselves as neighbours was inculcated
and observed. The internecine quarrels and the mutual plundering
of the later periods arose from the dissensions purposely sown
by the Scottish kings. To weaken the clans and the bond of
union existing between them unrighteous charters were granted
to certain lands in favour of pretenders that could present no valid
claim. Hence the majority of the clan feuds which frequently
drenched the Highland hills and glens with blood.</p>

<p>One particular result of the early teaching has been the national
respect for woman. It is one of the finest moral traits in the
character of the Gael. At this day it is among the Gael of the
Outer Hebrides and of the more recognised Celtic districts of Ireland,
such as Munster and Connaught, that the Registrar General
finds the smallest percentage of illegitimacy. The high-toned
morality which the poems of Ossian exhibit in this respect has
been used as an argument against their authenticity. And yet it
should be no argument at all for one who can trace out and
analyse the early sources whence developed the moral elements
of the national character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>The Celt has been generally very religious. The religion of the
Gael of Scotland, like that of the Kymry of Wales, whether in
ancient or in modern Christian times, has always flourished in an
atmosphere of deep severity. The rigid ethics of the early religion,
combined with a hard life at a distance from enervating centres of
civilisation, help to explain this. This sternness of doctrine also,
no doubt, prepared the modern Gael to accept with such absolute
entirety, and with such earnest heartiness, the Calvinistic system of
Christian truth which many regard as severe and harsh. The
higher results of the literary and moral culture of the Druidic
religion we have embodied in the relics of Ossianic poetry. The
order of Druids, with their ideals of philosophy and religion, have
vanished; but their power for good remains embedded in the
foundation of the national name, with its educating influences and
its inspiring associations. In this power lay the moral strength of
our early ancestors. Christianity, in its early Celtic and Reformed
stages, developed into higher and purer issues this national virtue;
and the character of the people is exponent of the results of the
process. Other tribes and communities have had Christianity
among them too, but with different results. This line of thought
suggests an explanation of why, as has been already remarked, the
Irish Gael appears to be somewhat unlike the Scottish Gael.</p>

<p>A glance may now be appropriately bestowed upon that other
somewhat mysterious body—those heroes called the Féinne.</p>

<p>Chief among the early Gaelic inhabitants was the renowned
order of heroes known as the Féinne, the Fianna, or the followers
of Fingal, or Finn, the leader. They are supposed to have lived
in the second and third centuries of our era, and to have been the
Caledonians who checked the progress of the legions of Rome.
Very little reliable help can be found regarding this question in
the extant annals of the Gael. In general it may be held that
this race of Finn came from the shores of the Baltic to North
Britain, and that they were not unrelated to the ancient Norse.
Recently a new theory has been adopted by some, like Mr Campbell
of Islay, whose views are entitled to much respect. They
argue that the existence of the Féinne is only a myth—part and
parcel of an old world system, not unconnected with the classical
and oriental—a system of which we have the same with variations
in the Militia of Ireland, and in the Knights of the Round Table
of the ancient British. It is held that Fingal and King Arthur
are the same personages; that Graine, the faithless wife of Fingal
is the same as the faithless Guinevere, the spouse of Arthur; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
that the unhallowed love of Diarmad and Graine has a suggestive
similitude in that of Sir Launcelot and Guinevere. On the other
hand, it is argued that the similarity of these relations, however
systematic in appearance, may still be adequately explained by
the fact that human nature is much the same in all lands and
amongst all races; that this symbolic theory does not seem to be
supported by the well-grounded conviction of the people in whose
traditions the memory of the heroes of the Féinne has been handed
down to us; that it is not at all probable that the names of merely
fictitious heroes would live in the topography of a hundred hills,
like the name of Finn; that it does not find support in the more
philosophic theory regarding the heroes of ancient peoples—that
all the mythological characters are only exaggerations of real ones;
that human nature is never satisfied with the barely mythic and
unreal, and that the patriotic and other affections never derive
sustenance from false and unbelievable characters.</p>

<p>Can a vague statement of this character not satisfy the
inquiring student? To the patriotic Celtic inquirer, next in importance
to the evangelisation of the Highlands by Columba,
stands the great question of the Féinne, who have so indelibly
impressed their individualities on the Gaelic imagination of Scotland.
To the more inquiring spirits of recent times these brilliant
heroes have appeared very strange and mysterious indeed. They
have had a Melchisedec kind of existence in our traditional history;
no one has been able to suggest whence they came, or whither
they have gone. The names of their leaders have become woven
with fable, song, and story; with the hills and glens of Albin and
Erin; with the warlike struggles which the various conflicting races
have fought on our Ero-Albinic shores. So vague and romantic
however, has their history been, that a few clear-sighted writers,
conversant with comparative mythology, have come almost to the
conclusion that the Féinne were, as we have already seen, a mere
Gaelic expression of a world-wide mythus, whose various component
elements can be found from Japan to the Hebrides. The
popular tales and the bardic ballads have been regarded as the
<em>debris</em> that may be still collected on the shores of the ages.</p>

<p>The plain Highlander living in the mere tents of history and
literature, has been reluctant to accept so vague an account of a
very heroic ancestry. Has not he the poems of Ossian still in his
hands? Are not the names of Finn and fellow-heroes stamped on
a thousand hills in Albin and Erin? So the invariable conclusion
has been that in some mysterious way and during some mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
period “Fingal lived and Ossian sang.” The disappointing question
all along has been, however, where can any account be found
of these people in our accredited national histories? The inquiring
spirits among our patriotic youth examine recent histories
in vain. Our antiquaries write of names and places, but they have
failed to assign a local habitation and a name to the Finian people.
The only approach to a definite representation of the race we have
in the famous mystifications of James Macpherson in his dissertations,
notes, and poems. But the geography of Macpherson
appears to have been as mistily convenient for himself as it has
been perplexing to his commentators. Not even the genius of Dr
Waddell in his goodly volume has been able to identify the localities
of Macpherson, or remove the veil of ghost-like existence in
which the Ossianic heroes are enshrouded.</p>

<p>Our ordinary historians appear to have avoided treating of so
perplexing a period or class of men. Browne is satisfied with a
statement on the Ossianic question. He does not touch on the
history of the Finnic period. Keltie ignores the whole question.
MacLauchlan in his “Early History of the Scottish Church,”
which embraces the Ossianic age, has nothing to say of the Finnic
environment. In his introduction to his edition of Ossian, Clerk
is equally silent as to the accurate identification of the people of
whom Ossian became the laureate bard. Nor is anything very
definite to be found even in the learned works of Skene. When
such admirable authorities are almost universally silent, it becomes
a very hazardous matter to attempt any statement on the question.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that hitherto the sources of much of our
definite accounts have been Irish compilations. Notwithstanding
Macpherson’s comparative contempt for the character of the Irish
Finian heroes, and for the Irish Ossianic compositions, yet much
of the ground work of his own historic ideals was furnished by
Irish productions. But any historic truth the Irish compositions
may have had perished in the using in the hands of Macpherson.
The result has been a system of chronology that neither he nor
his friends have ever been able to explain.</p>

<p>The question still remains, Who were the Féinne? The answer
in general has been that they were Gaelic heroes of the second
and third centuries of the Christian era; who fought with Romans,
with Danes, and with one another; and finally struggled with the
converting powers of Christianity. In Ireland they have appeared
under the guise of a Milesian militia, a conception which is
thoroughly in harmony with the chivalrous ideals of that interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
island. The following sentences contain the gist of all the
information that is now available:—“It is quite a mistake to
suppose <i lang="gd">Finn Mac Cumhaill</i> to have been merely imaginary or
mythical character. Much that has been narrated of his exploits
is, no doubt, apocryphal enough; but Finn himself is an undoubtedly
historical personage; and that he existed about the time at
which his appearance is recorded in the annals, is as certain as
that Julius Cæsar lived and ruled at the time stated on the
authority of the Roman historians. I may add here that the
pedigree of Finn is fully recorded on the unquestionable authority
of the Book of Leinster, in which he is set down as the son of
<i lang="gd">Cumhall</i>, who was the son of <i lang="gd">Trenmor</i>, son of <i lang="gd">Snaelt</i>, son of <i lang="gd">Eltan</i>,
son of <i lang="gd">Baiscni</i>, son of <i lang="gd">Nuada Necht</i>, who was of the Heremonian
race, and monarch of Erinn about A.M. 5090, according to the
chronology of the Four Masters, that is, 110 years before Christ.
Finn himself was slain, according to the Annals of the Four
Masters, in Anno Domini 283, in the reign of <i lang="gd">Cairbre Lifeachair</i>.”
Little can be added to this statement by O’Curry. The great
battle of <i lang="gd">Gabhra</i>—Garristown in Meath—took place in 284; and
the ballads represent the brave Oscar, and <i lang="gd">Cairbre Lifeachair</i> as
falling by each others’ hands in the deadly struggle. Oscar was
the beloved son of Ossian, and his grandfather Finn, who died a
year before the battle of <i lang="gd">Gabhra</i>, is brought back to life by the
Romancists to pronounce a eulogy on the fallen Oscar.</p>

<p>Irish annalists are satisfied that the fatherland of Finn and his
heroes was Ireland; but no one appears to be able to point out
the territories over which Finn reigned. It is an undoubted fact
that <i lang="gd">Cairbre Lifeachair</i> was the monarch of Erin when Finn died,
and when the battle of <i lang="gd">Gabhra</i> was fought. What can be more
natural then than to suppose with Macpherson that Finn was
monarch of Albin? In Macpherson’s works Finn is represented
always as going from Albin to Erin, a rendering of history which
the Irish authorities refuse to accept. When we look for the
Kingdom of Finn in Scotland where Macpherson has located it,
we certainly fail to ascertain its boundaries by means <a id="tn-13">of his mystifying</a>
phrases. That his Morven is not the Mor<em>vern</em> of Argyllshire
has been pointed out long ago; nor is much satisfaction to be
found in Dr Clerk’s interpretation of <i lang="gd">Mor Bheanna</i>, the Great
Hills, as a general characteristic of Scotland. It is another illustration
of Macpherson’s prudent indefiniteness behind which the
secret of his works has been preserved.</p>

<p>Now it appears to me that I am led aright in my studies of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
period of Albin’s history, when I regard the Féinne as the last
leaders of the great race in Albin and Erin who disappeared in
history before the extension of the Gaelic conquest and supremacy.
The spirit of their struggle is truly recorded in the ballads when it
is repeatedly declared that they went forth to the battle, but that
they always fell. This is the melancholy key-note of the Ossianic
poetry. This is the passionate patriotism—a brave, resolute and
chivalrous race, ever ready for the fight, ever ready to go forth to
battle—and has always appealed to the popular heart. The brave
Finians, however, seemed to go forth to die. The fate of possible
extinction appears to have pressed heavily on the heart of the
people. And when the leaders were all dead and gone, Ossian
the immortal singer of their exploits and enterprises mourned in
his blindness and solitude the departure of his brother heroes and
hunters,—dwelling with pathetic tenderness on the oft-recurring
refrain: “The last of my race!”</p>

<p>The Albinian monarchy, whose head-quarters were situated
near Loch Ness, exercised rule over various tribes. Early in our
era its sway appears to have extended, to use the proverbial sayings,
from the Ord of Caithness to the Rhinns of Islay, from the
Hen of Lewis to the Cock of Arran: <i lang="gd">O’n Ord Ghallach gus an
Roinn Ilich, ’s o’n Chirc Leoghaisich gus a’ Choileach Arranach</i>.
This Albinian kingdom was, no doubt, the scene of the Finian
exploits which have formed the subjects of poetic romance. It
was frequently assailed by the Norse on the north-west and east;
and by Celts on the south-east. The latter finally prevailed, bestowing
their Celtic tongue on the conquered Albinians. The
Féinne appear to have been the last leaders of the national cause.
They were probably bilingual, as the more educated classes were
in the days of Columba. Many of them may have been fully
Gaelicised, while resisting the encroachments of an alien civilisation.
Ossian and his fellow-leaders would be of this class. And
just as many patriot bards in our own time in Ireland and Britain,
lament the decay of Celtic nationalities in the language of the
Teutonic conqueror, so the laureate bard of the Albinian people
has sung of “the last of his race” in the tongue of the conquering
Gael.</p>

<p>The kindred of these remarkable heroes appeared in those early
ages in various lands. They were the immediate predecessors,
not only of the Celtic, but in some cases also of other races. They
were the most ancient Lochlins that ploughed the German Ocean
with their trembling barks. They were the earliest Vikings that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
sailed round the Orkneyan skerries; that visited their kindred and
fought with them on the shores of Albin, of Erin, and of Breatun.
And clearly it is their connections we have in the north-east
of Europe, where they survive in a trying climate with
shrunk proportions and exhausted national energies. The famous
ballad on the <em>Battle of Gabhra</em> represents four companies of
Finians as engaged in the terrible fight—the Féinne of Albin, the
Féinne of Erin, the Féinne of Breatun, and the Féinne of Lochlin.</p>

<p>The names of these heroes are still to be found in Lochlin,
Erin, and Albin, the lands in which their celebrated deeds were
chiefly performed. We find them in the pages of Adamnan like
the shadows of a departing people. Finn or Fionn, appears in
various forms, as in <i lang="gd">Findchanus</i>, <i lang="gd">Fintenus</i>, &amp;c. Here we have
also the first, or most ancient, written form of the name of the
great bard himself, in Latin disguise, “Oisseneo nomine.”</p>

<p>The territory of the Caledonians lay from Loch Long eastward
to the Firth of Tay and the German Ocean, and northward in
later times to the Moray Firth. The Caledonian Forest is represented
as extending in a north-eastern direction from Loch
Lomond to the river Isla. The Caledonian territories, however,
were always shifting. Like the <em>Celtica</em> of the Continent of Europe,
the <i lang="gd">Gaeltachd</i> of the British Islands <a id="tn-15">was always under</a> a process of
change, but at the same time it was ever the region or the land of
the Gael. Lands were won from the tribes whom the Gaels conquered,
while territories were surrendered to those who pressed on
behind them. At first the <i lang="gd">Gaeltachd</i> was in South Britain; but as
the Gaels moved northward, Albin contracted, and the land of
the Gael extended. Finally, the Caledonians became the general
term for all the Gaelic clans who opposed the legions of Rome.</p>

<p>The etymology of <em>Caledonia</em> has not been satisfactorily explained.
The celebrated James Macpherson explains it as follows:—“When
South Britain yielded to the power of the Romans, the
unconquered nations to the north of the province were distinguished
by the name of <em>Caledonians</em>. From their very name, it
appears that they were of those Gauls, who possessed themselves
originally of Britain. It is compounded of two Celtic words,
<em>Gael</em>, signifying <em>Celts</em> or <em>Gauls</em>, and <em>Dun</em> or <em>Don</em>, <em>a hill</em>; so that
<em>Gael don</em>, or Caledonians, is as much as to say <em>Celts of the hill
country</em>.” In the very next sentence Macpherson unconsciously
suggests quite a different and better etymology: “The Highlanders
to this day call themselves <em>Gael</em>, their language <em>Gaelic</em> or <em>Galic</em>,
and their country <em>Gaeldoch</em>, which the Romans softened into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
<em>Caledonia</em>.” Consideration for Latin Inflections would readily
transform <em>Caeldachd</em> into <em>Caledonia</em>. A rival explanation has
found place in many school books—Coille-daoine, rendered <em>Men
of the Wood</em>. This, however, is not the accurate translation. The
compound is absurd and unnatural. It reads to a Gael like <em>Men-Wood</em>
in English. Another explanation has been <i lang="gd">Gaedhil dhonna</i>,
brown-haired Gaels; but physiological facts and the laws of phonology
do not support this derivation. The Welsh have given us
its meaning from a Cymric standpoint; and as the word is unknown
in Gaelic in its historic form the Welsh suggestions appear
very reasonable. The Caledonian Forest in Welsh has always
been Calydin or Celydin, a term which means <em>Wood</em>. Its Gaelic
cognate would be <i lang="gd">Coilltean</i>, which also supplies the representative
consonants of Caledonia. The great forest of the Central Highlands
would be very naturally spoken of as the <em>Woods</em>, Coiltean;
<i lang="la">Caledonii</i> being only a Latin derivative.</p>

<p>With the spread of Christianity the Caledonians became the
great people in Albin. In the later ages they consisted of Gaelicised
Albinians, Gaels, and Brythonised Gaels. Among them
appeared those who stand first on the roll of literary Scots: the
poetry and tales of the Féinne developed into their present shape
in the hands of the ancient Christian Gaels of our land. The
poetic compositions which relate to this period furnish us with
gleams of life from the borderland of decadent heathenism and
Christianity.</p>

<p>From the first proclamation of the latter onwards the outlines of
Scottish story become continually clearer, shining more and more
until the day of national freedom and independence shone on a
brave and struggling people. In glancing very briefly at the
history of the Gael of Albin we find that it naturally suggests the
following periods, described by terms which indicate the fresh
elements introduced on fresh changes taking <span class="nowrap">place:—</span></p>

<p>I. The Pre-Celtic Period embraces the unrecorded ages which
partially terminated in the third century, when the influence of
Christianity began to be felt. The Roman province in Scotland
became nominally Christian by the Imperial adoption of Christianity
by Constantine in the year 313.</p>

<p>II. The Celtic Period extends from the third century to the
year 1068. During these dark and unsettled times there was much
intercourse carried on between the old inhabitants of Albin and
the people of Lochlin; generally the intercourse took the form
of a fierce struggle for supremacy. In 1068 Malcolm III. married<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
an English princess, known afterwards as the saintly Queen Margaret;
Gaelic afterwards ceased to be the language of the Scottish
Court. At that time Picts and Scots being united under one
monarchy the sway of the Northmen in the north-west became
much enfeebled. The power of the latter was completely broken
by the disastrous defeat of Haco, at Large, in 1263.</p>

<p>III. The Norman or Feudal Period extends from 1068 to 1567.
Few of the Gaelic preachers, or representatives of the early Scottish
Church, survived the repressing influence of Queen Margaret, who
was a zealous Roman Catholic. The Norman conquest of England
caused many Saxons to seek refuge in Scotland, where they were
welcomed by the Queen and her royal husband, <i lang="gd">Ceann-Mor</i>.
Norman influences also began to be felt in Scotland. The lands
of Celtic chiefs were chartered away by the King to Norman
barons, of whom many became as Celtic and as identified with the
Gaelic inhabitants as the Celtic mormaers whom they supplanted.
The patriarchal system began to decay, and feudalism was gradually
introduced.</p>

<p>IV. The Protestant and Jacobite Period extends from the
middle of the sixteenth century to the year 1745, when Jacobitism
on Culloden Moor received its death-blow. The nominal first,
afterwards the actual, acceptance of the Reformation doctrines by
the Scottish Celts in the sixteenth century has very vitally affected
their literature, as well as completely changed their relations with
the Irish Celts.</p>

<p>V. The Anglo-Gaelic Period begins in 1745. The influence of
the English language and English thought has been extending in
the Highlands since then; while through the general intermingling
of races, and a better mutual understanding, the prejudices of Celt
and Saxon respectively have been everywhere dying away, especially
among the classes by whom the force of the democratic
tendencies of our age has been felt and acknowledged.</p>

<p>The dates assigned to the above periods are only approximately
accurate, but they may serve to shadow forth some of the chief
influences which have been at work in the history of Celtic Scotland,
and of which we have traces in the literary annals of the
Gael. Perhaps the surprising thing in connection with these
meagre annals is the fact that there are any literary remains at all,
when it is remembered how frequent and how violent have been
the changes which have occurred in the course of the history of
Albin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The Anglo-Gaelic era of Highland history commences, as has
been pointed out, with the decay of the Jacobite cause. The
changes that have taken place since 1745 have deeply affected the
destiny and character of the people. In some respects the contact
with the fresh forces brought into play was beneficial, in other
respects it was a moral loss; but it is to be hoped that on the
whole there has been considerable gain, and that not altogether
material.</p>

<p>Under the social and educational changes that have been taking
place during the last century the Highlanders have shown wonderful
adaptableness in the course of the process they have been
undergoing. The revival of a more earnest spirit of Christianity
in many districts has completely altered the social habits of the
people, while the influence of educational agencies has reached
the most secluded glen and remote headland.</p>

<p>The English language is everywhere taught, the people, knowing
its use in the sphere of secular success, preferring to have their
children educated in a purely English rather than in a Gaelic
school. The present rising generation all understand and talk a
little Saxon of some sort, but Gaelic will be the language of the
mass of the population for some generations yet. English thought
and culture also reach the people through the hundreds of University-bred
ministers who preach Gaelic in Highland pulpits.</p>

<p>These important changes in the Celtic world are not effected
without many venerable regrets being uttered by sentimentalists
both in Ireland and Scotland. If we look across the channel we
find that the Irish Gael indulges in the same unpractical wail over
an irrevocable past, that we find so prevalent with his brother of
Albin. The cry of the sentimentalist there is even more intense,
more persistent. The unpromising present of the Gael there
appears to attract like a magnet all the revolutionary sympathies
of the usually stolid Teutonic heart, after a little contact of the
races. Just as in their political difficulties the Irish have always
looked for help from Spain, France, or America, so unless the
gods somehow interfere to preserve their native tongue, all they
can or will do, waiting for external or divine deliverance, is to
take up the refrain—“It is dying.” This is how an Irish poet,
the Rev. M. Mullin, Clonfert, sings with incomparable <span class="nowrap">sadness:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“It is fading! it is fading! like the leaves upon the trees;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is dying! it is dying! like the Western Ocean breeze!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is fastly disappearing, as footsteps on the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the Barrow, and the Erne, and Lough Swilly’s waters roar;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the parting sunbeam kisses the Corrib in the West,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the ocean, like a mother, clasps the Shannon to its breast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The language of old Erin, of her history and name—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of her monarchs and her heroes, of her glory and her fame—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacred shrine where rested, through her sunshine and her gloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Spirit of her martyrs, as their bodies in the tomb!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The time-wrought shell where murmured, through centuries of wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The secret voice of Freedom in annal and in song</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is surely, fastly sinking into silent death at last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To live but in the memories and relics of the Past!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It must be very consoling to give one’s grief utterance in this
highly poetical fashion; it is a question whether the poetry loses
or gains in force, when it is remembered that the singer perhaps
never put forth any effort to preserve the life of that ancient
tongue which he is harping into her grave. Perhaps he does not
know the language at all. He may be among those who first
spurned and then starved her scholars; of the sentimentalists who,
after learned devotees gave to the world in books the results of a
life’s labour, on the publication of which they had expended more
than all their own means, might borrow but would not buy a copy.
The accomplished Archbishop MacHale of Tuam, found out to
his cost the full meaning of this remark. Few were the copies of
his excellent Græco Irish Homer that were sold; and here we
have an illustration of the extent of the encouragement that real
Irish scholarship receives. At the same time it must be admitted
that the writers of Celtic books are frequently much to blame.
They bury their productions in expensive volumes which can never
obtain general circulation, or they do not furnish the precise thing
required; or if they do, it is not always in a saleable popular
fashion. Thus we have to regret the evil results of contemptuous
neglect on the one hand, and extravagant claims and impracticable
theories on the other, as well as an imaginary sense of loss and
wrong, on the part of those who ought to give a more practical
direction to the people’s sentiments.</p>

<p>But the Celt is neither dead nor dying. He is still an important
factor in the making of the world’s history. Apart from the
very large Celtic element that has been absorbed in the Anglo-Celtic
intermingling of races under the supremacy of Teutonic rule
in these islands we find some four or five millions of people talking
one or other of the Celtic dialects. The number of Gaelic
speaking Highlanders is not much under half a million. There
will be about 300,000 of a Gaelic-speaking population within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
geographical limits of the Highlands, the area of which is upwards
of three-fifths of Scotland. There is a larger Gaelic population in
Glasgow than the whole population of Greenock. The Gaelic bard
of to-day has thus as large an audience to sing his lays to as the
great Ossian himself had in ancient Albin.</p>

<p>Still it is constantly asserted that whether or not the Gaelic
language is dead and ready for burial it has no literature; and the
assertion has been repeated for several generations with emphatic
persistence. The following chapters are intended to show that
there is a literature; and that it does not altogether deserve the
contempt with which it has been hitherto regarded. And the
English-reading public have a right to know from the pens of
Gaelic scholars what is the value of the literature still extant in the
ancient language of a people with whom they are so closely united,
and who form an important integral portion of their common empire.
All have an interest in bringing the reign of ignorance,
apathy, and prejudice to an end.</p>

<p>At last in the midst of neglect and apathy, of petty rivalries and
discords which so readily breed within circumscribed spheres, when
our Gaelic scholars, MacLauchlan and Clerk, Skene and J. F.
Campbell, and others, were giving to the world the results of their
laborious efforts to uphold the character and literary prestige of
their countrymen, and were thus paving the way, one voice began
to be heard on behalf of a despised language and literature. That
voice crying in the Highland wilderness was that of Professor
Blackie! By inimitable eloquence and unwearied energies he
interested high and low at once and for years in the establishment
of a Celtic Chair in the University of Edinburgh. From the Queen,
from lord and laird, and from peasant, he charmed, by his sweet
and natural manner, the gold on which that Chair is now so successfully
founded. Not only that, but he has also given us the
fullest account hitherto published of the language and literature of
the Scottish Highlands. It is needless to speak of the affection
and gratitude which Highlanders cherish towards the learned and
venerable Professor, who has been a most potent Celtic force in
this generation. “<i lang="gd">Saoghal fada ’n deagh bheatha dhuit!</i>”</p>

<p>Irish scholars have recently laboured hard and successfully in
furthering the interests of their native literature. It is enough here
to mention the names of O’Donovan, O’Currie, Whitley Stokes,
Joyce, Standish O’Grady, and Bourke—men whose learning and
talents would adorn the literary annals of any nation. While the
Irish have accomplished more than the Scottish Gael, the Welsh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
have done more than either to preserve their language and cultivate
their literature. Under systematic efforts to suppress it
entirely the Kymry have adhered to their ancient tongue with
unwearying pertinacity. While the Gael of Ireland and Scotland
have not yet been successful in supporting one purely Gaelic newspaper,
the Celt of Wales has his Welsh newspaper in every town
of importance in the Principality. It is to the Kymry that we
owe the best work yet published on Celtic philology—the “Welsh
Philology” of Professor Rhys of the Celtic Chair at Oxford. So
now it may fairly be said that we are in the midst of a Celtic
Renaissance. Books of a certain useful character do sell, notwithstanding
the well founded complaint referred to above. The first
edition of Canon Bourke’s “Aryan Origin of the Gaelic Race”
was exhausted in a very short time. Campbell’s “Tales” are out
of print. These are signs of the times which, along with the establishment
of Celtic Chairs at the central seats of learning, decisively
indicate a reviving interest in Celtic studies. In talking once of
the emotional element of the Celtic nature, an enthusiastic Irish
scholar jocularly remarked to the writer that the Gael was dying
away in song. If this turns out to be true, it is evident that his
remains will be examined with pious and scientific care.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that, meagre as Gaelic literature is—and
the great wonder is that what we have should have been produced
in so unpromising a field—it extends over sixteen centuries. Its
stream issued from that fount of Gaelic heroism which began to
burst forth in the first centuries of our era, when the ground of the
old European world was on every side shaken by the heavy tramp
of the Roman legions and by the consequent disturbance of equilibrium
among the clans and races everywhere. Epic products of
genius, of course, there are not in Gaelic literature. Perhaps the
pure Celtic genius, as Mathew Arnold held, is incapable of producing
epic works—is too emotional, and is only rich in lyrical and
ballad power. Great works requiring leisure, quietness, and perseverance
there are not; the life of our ancestors, active, earnest,
and practical—its energies ceaselessly being called forth to combat
the ruthless forces of nature—did not admit of the necessary
cultivation and ease for such productions. Extensive fruits of
Gaelic thought and letters we do still possess, however, although
much has been lost, especially of what was produced in earlier days.
But these should not for a moment be spoken of in comparison
with the magnificent monuments of intellectual endeavour which
Greece and Rome and Anglo-Celtic Britain have reared. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Gaelic literature will compare favourably with that of many other
countries, especially when united with its sister product, Irish
literature. And Welsh literature, no doubt, should also be added.
English literature, because of the basis it has in the soil of Christianity,
is the grandest product of the human intellect, the master works
of Greece and Rome not excepted. It is great; it is partly Celtic;
and we, as Anglo-Celts, admire it. But we may with advantage
look beyond the bounds of our English studies, and then see more
clearly the foundation of our Anglo-Celtic empire when we have
examined with tender and sympathetic care the interesting relics
of Celtic thought enshrined in the ancient language of the British
Islands.</p>

<p>It ought perhaps to be acknowledged that the English-speaking
peoples of these islands are, at present peculiarly ready to accept
any authentic information respecting Celtic history and literature.
The same remark replies to Continental scholars. In our own
islands the stirring of nationalities in Ireland, Scotland and Wales,
and that simultaneously with the movements of the practical politics
of the parties of the day and the advocacy of the reform of our
land laws, has deepened the interest in all questions relating to
Celtic life and thought.</p>

<p>It is a mere truism to remark that the language and literature of
the Gael have been much neglected. All attempts to bring their
claims before the English-speaking world were, till recently, treated
with systematic indifference if not with contempt. The national,
historical, and scientific value of the study of both does not appear
to have occurred even to many who ought to know better. Interesting
and inviting as the field was, it lay long unoccupied.
Highlanders conscious of some talent were attracted by the rich
prizes and honour obtainable within the sphere of English letters.
A few who dipped into Celtic studies found them either unprofitable
or turned away with disgust from a path in which they were
met on all sides with petty jealousies and ignorant pretence. The
Rev. Dr John Smith, of Campbeltown, distinguished alike for his
learning and general culture, sacrificed much of his time and means
to Gaelic studies; and, finding them unprofitable, turned in his
leisure hours to farming on his glebe. He was also annoyed by a
truthless, pedant schoolmaster, Duncan Kennedy, of Lochgilphead,
who laid claim to the authorship of some ballads which Dr Smith
had published. The English Republic of letters could not be
blamed for disregarding the intellectual history of a people who
ignored their own productions and all that they inherited from their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
ancestors. Yet is it a reproach to Irish and British scholars that
Continental students should be the first to create interest in Celtic
studies and place them on a scientific basis. The real parties,
however, who ought to bear the blame are the Celts themselves—the
Kymry of Wales, and the Gael of Ireland and Scotland. It is
with much propriety that Professor Geddes of Aberdeen, thus
addresses British Celts with regard to their languages:—“<em>Your</em>
advantages are great. To you it is a mother-speech, whereas to
others like myself it has to be laboriously learned, and after all
imperfectly, so that it can hardly be said to be a speech at all in
such mouths as mine. It is otherwise with you; you are within
the shrine, such as I are without, and just as the radiance of a
cathedral window, rich with the spoils of time, looks blurred and
poor to the eye that seeks to comprehend it from without, but
streams in full glory on the eye that gazes from within, so your
native speech rightly studied ought to be to you resplendent with
linguistic treasures, such as no stranger can be expected to unveil.”
The Highlander alone can fully know and appreciate the language
and literature of his race. But if he takes up the obsolete harp of
his fathers, and rehearses in melancholy strains that his people are
perishing and that his language is dying, it is quite natural, that
his Teutonic neighbour should chime in with an emphatic and not
always a sympathetic amen.</p>

<p>This sort of harping is the species of music with which many
Highlanders, and Irish Gaels also, have been pleased to humour
and feed their patriotic feelings over the general neglect of Celtic
interests. Well may the disinterested spectator declare that they
are not much in earnest—that the wail is partly hypocritical; for
they have done so little to preserve their language and nationality.
And no doubt the cry is to a certain extent hypocritical with not
a few self-constituted patriots, and the bulk of the people disregard
it. The latter do not take up the wail, and they are mainly in the
right. The enthusiast and the sentimentalist, who indulge in the
dirge, run away with one small truth, or the phase of a truth—with
a pathetic misconception of the true state of things. Sometimes
they hire themselves to do the coronach, like the Irish professional
mourners who do the wailing over the departed. But the people
in general are not drawn by the charming of the sentimentalist;
they are more practical. They know and feel the power of circumstances
and destiny which they have to overcome and bear, and
act accordingly. While they find their native hills barren, and
their native glens inhospitable, they betake themselves to the rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
woods of Canada and the prairies of the United States. Witness
what a large body of the Glengarry Highlanders once did. Again,
when they find the want of the English language a bar to their
secular success in life, they protest, while cherishing dearly their
native tongue, against pure Gaelic schools being thrust upon them,
and demand English teaching first. This has been the case not so
long ago in the Long Island. And the reason is quite patent.
Before arriving at school age the children are in possession of their
mother-tongue; and the parents consider, and very rightly, that
the sooner their sons and daughters acquire good English the
better for their own comfort, interest, and success in the great
English-speaking world in which they have necessarily to perform
a part. English ought to be taught from the first through, and
simultaneously with, the Gaelic. In all this the people show that
their utilitarianism is sensible, intelligent. They recognise the facts
of their surroundings. They listen to the charming of the sentimentalist,
but they go on their own practical way rejoicing.
Hundreds of Highlanders in our large towns never enter a Gaelic
church. English-speaking mothers and children do not find the
arrangement of services convenient and, consulting the general
good of all the members of the family, they take their seats elsewhere.
In this they cannot be deeply blamed. In Scotland we
are quite familiar with the stereotyped arguments and phraseology
which are applied to depopulation and other matters. But many
of those who rehearse the one on public platforms and weave the
other into elegiac verse do not always give us a practical illustration
of their theories and teaching by living in the Highlands and
by having Gaelic taught in their own families.</p>

<p>This conviction and cry of the imaginative Celt that the world
is slipping from his grasp—that his affairs are in a hopeless condition—has
done much injury to his own interests. And it is not
at all surprising although his neighbours and the rising generation
of his own people have regarded his language and literature with
persistent indifference. Ossian himself is proverbially known to us—“<span lang="gd">Oisein
an déigh na Féinne</span>”—as the “last of the race.” It
would almost seem that every generation of Gaels during the last
millennium regarded itself as the last of the “race.” Yet, strange
to say, the Gaelic language is spoken to-day within pretty nearly
the same limits as it was a thousand years ago, a fact encouraging
to the sanguine and poetic natures of men like William
Livingston, that very original Islay bard, who once sang as

<p>The present state of our knowledge does not enable us to assign
an exact date to the first beginnings of Gaelic literature. The most
ancient ballads have certainly come down to us through the hands
of Gaelic Churchmen; and it may be taken as absolutely certain
that writing was unknown until it was introduced by Christian
missionaries. The monuments of Runes and Oghams, the study
of which may be pursued in the works of Stephens, Anderson,
and Ferguson, can scarcely be regarded as literature in the proper
sense of the term. At the threshold of the temple of Gaelic letters
we are confronted with one name which can not be ignored—that
of Ossian which we see inscribed on the portals.</p>

<p>In his days and those of his peculiar people, the Féinne, the
Pagan and pre-Celtic Period was coming to a close. Let us look
a little at the picture that has been handed down to us of this great
bard with whom the heathen dispensation ended.</p>

<p>That a Fingal lived and an Ossian sang is a proposition that
cannot be successfully disputed. It was in the eighteenth century,
when James Macpherson published his fragments of ancient Gaelic
poetry, that the controversy which rages yet around the name of
Ossian arose. This controversy, as well as the poems, English and
Gaelic, published by Macpherson, will be afterwards considered.
In the meantime, the name of Ossian is used in a conventional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
sense, just as the name Homer is frequently used. He lived, let
us say, in the third or fourth century, when the heathen dispensation
of the pre-Celts and of the Gaels was drawing to a close, when the
Druidic period, with its mysteries, was coming to an end. It is
neither affirmed nor denied here at this stage that Ossian was the
author of the Gaelic poems at present in circulation, and from which
Macpherson ostensibly translated. But what may be safely
affirmed is, that there was in the days of Gaelic heathenism an
eminent bard of the name of Ossian, who started the key-note of
some poetry, which may be styled Ossianic. That fragments of
his compositions have been handed down to us may with equal
safety be affirmed. But of the early poems and ballads contained
in Campbell’s “<span lang="gd">Leabhar na Féinne</span>” we are absolutely unable to
say which was composed by Ossian or which by his imitators and
others. In that vast and valuable collection there may be pieces
of Ossian’s; and certainly the authorship of many poems is directly
attributed to him, though evidently in many cases by loose tradition.
His name is also attached to several productions which can
easily be proved to belong to some unknown authors. “<span lang="gd">A hoodir
Oisein</span>” would be readily prefixed by reciters and scribes to any
anonymous piece of merit to gain currency for it.</p>

<p>But granting that Ossian is not a myth, but a veritable man who
was a great bard among his people, a further question arises, Was
the poet Irish or Scottish? The Irish have all along declared that
the true and original Ossian belonged to them, and lived in their
country. Their indignation over Macpherson’s productions knew
no bounds. All Macpherson’s heroes are represented as <em>going
from</em> Alba <em>to</em> Erin, which harmonizes well with the recent deliverances
of Sayce and Rhys. He described all the Irish Ossians
as fictions and fables manufactured by monks in the Middle Ages,
and as so far inferior to the genuine remains of Ossian as the most
insipid heroics of the present day are to the immortal productions
of Homer. He showed that their system of chronology could not
be harmonised—that it was, in fact, absurd. As represented in
the everlasting dialogues between the poet and the saint, he asked
how could Ossian, who was supposed to live in the third century,
hold converse with St. Patrick, who did not arrive in Ireland till
the fifth century? No such objections could be brought against
Macpherson’s Ossian, whose chronology was, perhaps conveniently
vague, fairly consistent with itself. The Irish <i lang="la">literati</i> then betook
themselves to the manufacture of poems <i lang="fr">a la</i> Macpherson, whom
they denounced first as a thief and afterwards as a forger. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
they failed to produce any poems of such superior merit as those
of Macpherson, the theory of theft from the Irish was given up,
and that of forgery substituted. It was quite evident that the
Scottish “Ossian” published by Macpherson was very different
from the composer of Irish ballads and Finian tales. It was admitted
by the Scottish patriots that there was a Scottish Ossian
very like the Irish one—that of the later or heroic ballads and of the
popular tales. But they held that this was a spurious, inferior,
and more recent bard or bards, who attached the name of the great
father of Gaelic poetry to their own productions; and that the
genuine, true, and original poems of Ossian, the immortal poet of
the ancient Caledonians, were translated and published by Macpherson.
The claims of the two countries cannot be satisfactorily
adjusted or reconciled. History, however, conclusively shows that
the Gaels of the North of Ireland and those of Scotland were at
this period very closely related—were, indeed, but one people.
Just as Shakespeare is claimed by all sections of the English-speaking
world as their common heritage, so Ossian would be regarded
by all the Gaelic-speaking tribes or clans as their common property.</p>

<p>Ossian occupies the same place in both the Irish and Scottish
genealogies of the great Finian family. He is the son of Finn or
Fingal, the father of the brave and peerless Oscar, the chief bard
of his people.</p>

<p>Fionn, whose name means <em>fair</em>, the leader, and king of the
Féinne, is the most remarkable figure in the annals of the Gael.
The popular conception of his prowess may be gathered from the
following grand passage of Highland <span class="nowrap">poetry:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">This is a picture of Fingal going to battle, and a “terrible sight,”
indeed it must have been, especially to his foes. The leader of
the Féinne was surrounded by a worthy band of followers. The
bards and senachies, or oralists, agree in the character, outlines,
and abilities of these heroes. Ossian, the son of Fingal, was himself
a hero; but, being generally a supposed narrator, gives us
little insight into his own distinctive character. He was a great
bard, a brave warrior, but an unobtrusive man. His son Oscar
was the pride and hope of Selma, peerless as to strength and skill
in arms, generous to a fallen foe, and ever ready to meet the
fiercest champion that ever came from Lochlin. Gaul or Goll is
stout and valiant, and next to Oscar in prowess, but is at times
morose. He is never worsted, but he never courts danger for its
own sake. The beautiful and brown-haired Diarmad cannot be
seen by any woman without being loved. He is devoted to his
brothers in arms, and when necessary he can combine sleight of
hand with heroic daring. Cailte is a poet, and celebrated for his
swiftness of foot. Then there is the hardy Rayne, the majestic
Cochulin, and the faithful though rash Conan. Fingal himself has
been limned from more than one point of view by the oralists.
His greatness and courage in battle are indisputably pre-eminent.
He is a prudent, cautious general, and disapproves of unnecessary
bloodshed. In affairs of the heart he is relentless towards a rival,
generous though he is in other respects. The worst thing that
can be recorded of him is his unfeeling and revengeful conduct
towards his nephew, the gallant Diarmid, when the latter eloped
with Queen Gràine. These were the principal warriors of that
gallant band of Finian heroes whose names are indelibly engraven
on the hills and straths of their native land, while their deeds are
recorded in a thousand songs. They lived at a time when the
world was undergoing <a id="tn-30">a mighty metamorphosis</a>. Tribes were
beginning to assume a national cast, and as organised nations <a id="tn-30a">to
develop an</a> individuality. They were preparing to run the race
sketched out to them by destiny, the path of each bounded by a
particular line or limit of sea, stream, mountain, or valley, and
were throwing aside all the encumbrances of superseded customs
and laws that might clog their progress. Fingal and his followers
appeared in immortal brilliance, crowned with the laurels of deathless
heroism on the stage of the world, and soon they disappeared
from the scene. They were seen but for a short time like the sun
in a wintry day. And the picture is beautifully brought before us
in the following verses translated by <span class="nowrap">Pattison:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Ossian, the blind warrior-poet, survives them all. And now, as he
muses on the departure of his kindred heroes and hunters, and on
the loneliness of his own state, led by the white-armed Malvina,
the betrothed of his fallen son Oscar, he seeks their former haunts,
and breathes as he rests in the well-known shades the pathetic
lamentation, “the last of my race!”</p>

<p>From the picture of Ossian in his shadowy Pagan domain it is
refreshing to turn to those names which have played a great part
in connection with our earliest Christian civilization and literature.
They are the names of Patrick of Strathclyde, Bridget of the
South Gaels of Albin, and Columba of Donegal, subsequently of
Iona.</p>

<p>The first glimpse we have of Albin on the canvas of written
record is a very confusing one. The one outstanding fact is the
Roman occupation. The next fact that strikes and enchains the
eye is the presence of Christianity in the land. Among the Gaels
of the south-west of Scotland we mark the person of Ninian,
around whom we see across the ages the light of the gospel shining.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
This preacher of the cross, of whose labours in Galloway very interesting
traces were discovered quite recently, appears to have
carried the gospel not only to the Gaels of the south-west, but also
to the southern Picts north of the Forth and Clyde. His labours
began as early as the year 397, and resulted in the first church
organization known in Scotland. The evengelisation of Ninian
extended over probably the whole of Romanised Scotland towards
the end of the fourth century. The races embraced in his sphere
of operations were Latin-speaking peoples of various nations,
Brythons, and Gaels.</p>

<p>Among the last-mentioned, the Gaels of the Strathclyde kingdom,
whose chief seat was Alcluaidh, now Dumbarton, there
appeared the family of Patrick, whose name has shed holy lustre
on the early annals of that period. This family had been Christians
for two generations. The father of Patrick was a <i lang="la">decurio</i>, one of the
council or magistracy of a Roman provincial town. His name
was Calphurnius, which some have rendered by the familiar form
of MacAlpine. Being recognised as a Roman magistrate he thus
took his place among the local aristocracy of Banavem in Taberniæ,
where villas of the Roman style could be seen, and the sonorous
Latin could be heard mingling with the kindred accents of the
ancient Gaelic. This place was probably not far from that attractive
spot on the banks of the Clyde where a topographical monument
has been reared to the celebrated Irish apostle in Kilpatrick.
Calphurnius was not only a magistrate; he was also a deacon in
the Christian church. His own father, the grandfather of Patrick,
was called Potitus, and filled the office of Presbyter in the Strathclyde
church. It is also stated that this family cultivated a small
farm.</p>

<p>As there is a great deal of literature extant on the nativity of
Patrick which conflicts with the results of recent discussion, it may
be satisfactory to many to have the <a id="tn-32">latest authoritative</a> declarations
on the subject before them. No one has ever attempted to deprive
the north of Ireland of the honour of having supplied the
Highlands with the great gospel preacher who evengelised the
north-west; who revived the Christianity of the Lowlands; whose
earnest disciples supplied the north of England with the teachers
who converted its people to the power of Christ. But while Protestant
Scotland has made no attempts to deprive Ireland of its
Columban honours Catholic Ireland has persistently endeavoured
to denude Scotland of its legitimate claims to the honour of being
the fatherland of Patrick. Ireland’s misrepresentations have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
acquiesced in by Scotsmen, especially by timid historical writers,
of a certain ecclesiastical type, who have made needless concessions
to Romanist claims in connection with a question which is
purely historical. It is with peculiar pleasure that we are now
able to assign Patrick, the son of the Gaelic Church of Strathclyde,
his true place on the roll of Gaelic Scots; and to regard him as
a link in the Gospel succession which Columba brought with
him to the West Highlands.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Catholic Dictionary</cite>, issued a few years ago, and compiled
by Addis and Arnold of the Royal University of Ireland,
with the approving seal of his Eminence Cardinal Manning on its
publication, the following satisfactory sentence occurs: “The
general conversion of the Irish nation was reserved for St. Patrick,
who was probably born at the place now called Kilpatrick on the
Clyde whence he was carried as a slave into the north of Ireland while
still a youth.” To this there is appended a foot-note referring to
the excellent article of an Irish bishop on St. Patrick in one of the
Irish periodicals: “Dr Moran, Bishop of Ossory, who formerly
leant to the opinion that the place was near Boulogne in France,
has lately written convincingly in favour of the Scottish site.” The
Bishop’s article has finally decided the question; and has enabled
the Gaels of Scotland, with the tacit consent of their Irish brethren,
to add to the list of their heroic Christian missionaries, a name
whose brilliant halo of holy effort is unsurpassed in the ancient
annals of the Christian Church of these islands.</p>

<p>We are thus enabled to point out the first home of Christianity
among the Gaels of Scotland. We find it on the banks of the
Clyde, where many Christians of the same people, still talking the
same tongue, may still be found, rejoicing in the same Gospel.
The picture of this early Gaelic Church of Strathclyde from whose
bosom the devoted Patrick came forth, is in itself a sufficient
reason why the Early History of the Gaels should be re-written.
It is a chapter added to the Celtic civilisation of the Highland
people, which has been hitherto ignored or hidden through Roman,
Teutonic, or Norman influences.</p>

<p>A good deal has been written about Patrick’s visit to Rome,
where it was necessary to take him by the Romanist writers of later
times in order that he might receive consecration from an order
of Ecclesiastical Fathers which had scarcely yet developed. The
<cite>Catholic Dictionary</cite>, already quoted, is forced to confess, after
reference to Patrick’s autobiography in his <cite>Confession</cite> as
follows:—“He does not mention the Pope or the Holy See.” We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
thus find that in his own authentic writings Patrick makes no
reference to, or acknowledgment of, the Roman Bishop of his day.
The reason for this is not far to seek.</p>

<p>Patrick does not appear to have come in contact with any
Christianity except that which he was taught on the banks of the
Clyde in the Gaelic Church of his fathers. He had neither been
to Rome nor known the Roman Bishop (Celestine) of his time,
so he makes no reference to either in his genuine writings. On
this question his own words in his <cite>Epistle to Coroticus</cite> deserve
quotation—<i lang="la">Ego, Patricus, indoctus, scilicet, Hibernione, constitutum
episcopum me esse reor: a Deo accepi, id quod sum.</i> “I, Patrick,
an unlearned man, to wit, a bishop constituted to Ireland: what
I am I have received from God.” Thus in the establishment of
his Church Patrick in no instance appeals to any foreign Church,
Pope, or Bishop. On authority received from God he superintended
the Irish Church for 34 years. These clear statements of
his are utterly at variance with the fabricated ones which adorn
the lives of him which appeared centuries afterwards, and which
are now regarded as authorities by the fabulously inclined.</p>

<p>In his own writings Patrick gives us in a somewhat unconscious
manner a beautiful picture of his devoted character:—“I was
born free. I was the son of a father who was a decurio. I sold
my nobility for the advantage of this nation. But I am not
ashamed, neither do I repent; I became a servant for Jesus Christ
our Lord, so that I am not recognised in my former position.”
Elsewhere he says—“I was about 16 years old; but I knew not
the true God, and was led away into captivity to Hibernia, with a
great many men, according to our deservings.” His occupation
for six years in Antrim was keeping cattle. But the spirit of the
Eternal took possession of him. “My constant business was to
keep the flocks; I was frequent in prayers, and the love and fear
of God more and more inflamed my heart. My faith and spirit
were enlarged, so that I said a hundred prayers in a day and nearly
as many at night, and in the woods and on the mountain I remained,
and before the light I arose to my prayers, in the snow, in
the frost, and in the rain; and I experienced no evil at all. Nor
was I affected with sloth, for the spirit of God was warm in me.”
This was the man that the Gaels of Strathclyde gave for the conversion
of Ireland to Christianity.</p>

<p>There are several interesting questions suggested by the nativity
and life of Patrick. The land of his birth is now clearly ascertained;
but there are subsidiary questions in connection with that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
fact which require further consideration. Was Patrick a Gael, a
Brython or one of non-Aryan races which as recently as the fifth
century were a powerful people? What language did he speak, or
what language did he acquire in his Christian conquest of Ireland?
Who were the Irish as a race, and how far they had been Christianised
before his arrival? As to the question of race, the evidence
appears to lean distinctly in favour of the conclusion that he was
a Gaidel and not a Brython, notwithstanding the Brythonic suggestiveness
of the letter <b>P</b> in his name. It ought not to be
forgotten also in connection with this question that the radical
differences between the Brythonic and Gaidelic dialects at this time
were far less important than they are now; and that the capital of
the district of Patrick’s birth-place had its earlier Gaidelic designation
of Alcluaidh before it received its Brythonic name of Dunbretton.
Philologists tell us of the loss of the letter <b>P</b> in the Gaidelic
dialects; but the phonologists on this question have not fully
cleared up the difficulties which are suggested by the fact that in
some of the most north-westerly districts of the Highlands at the
present time many of the non-Anglicised natives are incapable of
making a clear distinction between the letters <b>P</b> and <b>B</b>, and hard
<b>C</b> and <b>G</b>. If we take the evidence afforded by literature, we can
come to no other conclusion than that Patrick was of the Gaidelic
or Gaelic race; for if we have not actual compositions in the
Gaelic language by him we have productions in that language
ascribed to him by ancient countrymen who must have known what
his native tongue had been.</p>

<p>The language which Patrick appears to have acquired in course
of his missionary labours for Ireland’s conversion could have been
no other than that of the non-Aryan races, or <em>Cruthnic</em>—the prevailing
<em>Erinic</em>—probably related closely to the <em>Albinic</em>, which at
that time was spoken all over the north-west of Scotland. In the
north-east of Ireland he no doubt found considerable numbers of
the Gaidelic race, his kinsmen who had preceded him. But the
language of those who had been already partly converted by
Palladius, a semi-mythic saint, who is at least as much connected
with Albin as with Erin, was certainly different from that of the
large mass of the Irish people. To extend the conquests of
Christianity over the fair fields of Erin south as well as north, it was
necessary that Patrick should master the tongue of the non-Aryan
races. There can be no doubt that his labours in this direction
helped also to extend the area of the Gaelic-speaking regions,—the
more literary language of the incoming saint and his race<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
making natural acquisitions in every direction. Similar results
followed the Gospelising efforts of Columba in the Highlands in a
subsequent age.</p>

<p>The conclusions fairly deducible from a consideration of Patrick’s
life point to many interesting matters in connection with the
History of the Highland People. We obtain first a clear conception
of a living Christian church existing among the Romanised
Gaels of Strathclyde. We also learn that from the bosom of the
Gaelic Church of Ninian, decayed as it possibly may have been,
there came forth the great messenger of the Cross, who recalled
to life if he did not originate the forces of Christianity in Ireland.
Again we find the gospel succession of the spirit of truth, coming
back in a generation or two into the Highlands of Scotland in the
person of Columba. The lamp of heavenly wisdom, lighted on
the banks of the Clyde, which Patrick flashed over the fields of
Erin, became the holy beacon which the fervid fingers of Columba
planted on the shores of Iona.</p>

<p>The Scottish missionary that went to Ireland and became its
patron saint is often referred to in the early ballads, Irish and
Scottish. His Creed-Prayer is given here. It is a curious mixture
of dogma and poetry; but undevotional as it may seem to us
had the “green” and other coloured Finians of the day appropriated
its earnest petitions and aspirations they would be saved
the troubles of many “Pursuits.” It begins thus in prose:
<span lang="la">“Patraicc dorone innimmunsa.”</span> <em>Patrick made this hymn.</em> It
then states that it was made in the time of Leogaire, son of Neill.
The cause assigned to its composition was the need of “protection
with his monks against the mortal enemies who were in league
against the clerics.” It was to be a corslet of faith for soul and
body against demons, men, and vices. Demons could not stand
before the face of him who sang it; envy and poison could do
no harm; in this life it would be a safeguard against sudden death;
and it would be a covering of defence (<i lang="gd">lurech</i> in Gaelic, from the
Latin <i lang="la">lorica</i>) after death. When Patrick sang it as he went forth
to sow the faith the opposition of Leogaire gave way.</p>

<p>Then the hymn properly begins: The singer declares his belief
in the Trinity—in Threeness—confession of Oneness in the Creator
of the world.</p>

<p>Dr Cameron, who has a learned article on “St. Patrick’s Hymn”
in <cite>The Scottish Celtic Review</cite>, and to whose accurate prose translation
as well as to Dr Stokes’s in his Goidelica. I am so much
indebted in the above rendering, makes the following remark:—“This
hymn forms one of the Irish hymns in the ‘Liber Hymnorum,’
a MS. belonging to Trinity College, Dublin, and written, as Dr
Stokes conjectures, about the end of the eleventh or the beginning
of the twelfth century. The hymn itself, however, belongs to a
much earlier date.”</p>

<p>The chief dates in the life of Patrick, who was probably born
about 387, are his landing in Ireland in 432 when he is represented
as attending the assembly of the Irish Kings and Chieftains which
was held on the hill of Tara that year; his celebrated letter against
Coroticus in 453 to regulate church discipline; and his death
which occurred in 493.</p>

<p>A very remarkable incident, related in the “Book of Armagh”
and quoted in Todd’s “Life of Patrick,” which bears internal
evidence of high antiquity, and now evidently written at a time
when paganism was not yet extinct in the country, illustrates the
way in which Patrick set before the Celtic mind the faith which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
proclaimed. One morning he and his attendants repaired to a
fountain called Clebach at Cruachan, now Rath-croghan, an
ancient residence of the kings of Connaught. Thither came the
two daughters of King Laogharie, and on seeing the strangers
supposed them to be Duine Sidhe fairies, “men of the hills,” and
said to them, “Who are ye?” And Patrick said unto them, “It
were better for you to confess to our true God, than to inquire
concerning our race.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The first Virgin said,—</p>

<p>“Who is God?</p>

<p>“And where is God?</p>

<p>“How is He to be found?</p>

<p>“Is it in old age that He is to be found?”</p>

<p>‘They answered, “We believe.”</p>

<p>“Believe ye in repentance after sin?” “We believe.”</p>

<p>“Believe ye the unity of the Church?” “We believe.”</p>

heads. And they asked to see the face of Christ, and the Saint

Eucharist of God, and they slept in death.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">SOUTH ALBIN GAELS—BRIGIT.</span></h2>


<p>It has been usually taken too much for granted that the early
Christian preachers of Britain and Ireland succeeded in fully
Christianising the districts in which they laboured, and with which
their names are associated. This is a very imperfect apprehension
of the results of their efforts. No missionary of the cross could
excel Patrick and Columba in their enthusiasm for work, in their
devotion to the Gospel cause, and in their resolute attempt to
conquer the whole land for Christ. Yet we find that their evangelisation
of the races to which they were respectively sent was very
incomplete. Patrick writes of the large numbers who were converted
under his preaching, but there is no evidence that Christianity
was universally adopted by the whole people. On the contrary
it is clear that the Ardri, or chief king of Ireland, continued to
be a Pagan during the whole period of the mission of Patrick. It
was only in the year 513 that a Christian sovereign exercised rule
for the first time from the throne of Tara. This was some time
after the death of the apostle of Ireland, <a id="tn-41">which occurred in</a> 493.</p>

<p>While Patrick was labouring to lay the foundations of the Irish
Church, spiritual decay appears to have crept over the <a id="tn-41a">heart of
his</a> own native church among the Gaels of Strathclyde. The
poetic and literary flowering of this period we have in the person
of the celebrated Brigit. In those who are familiar with the
revivals and declensions of church life, as unfolded in history, such
a decay can excite no surprise. In our own times, with all the
rich aids of civilization and Christian literature, enkindling and
preservative that we possess, we find that one generation of earnest
believers in a district is frequently succeeded by an apathetic one.
So the living church of Strathclyde from which Patrick went forth,
was in a decadent condition when his name began to shine and
burn brightly on the shores of Erin.</p>

<p>There were many causes that contributed to the weakening of
this Gaelic Church of the Clyde valleys. The Roman arms had
been withdrawn and all over the Romanised provinces political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
disintegration set in. Dependence on a foreign rule, and the
enervating luxuries of more southern lands had not only paralysed
the native manliness of the British races, but had also greatly
emasculated the primitive Christianity of these islands. Indeed,
in southern Britain the early Christianity became so completely
extinguished that it had to be re-kindled from the north in the
sixth and seventh centuries. The vigorous forces of the unconverted
and unconquered tribes of the north were too powerful for a
Church which had been accustomed perhaps to lean too much on
the civil protection afforded by an alien power. It must not also
be forgotten that those early Christians had literally no help to
feed the flame of their devotion. The fragments even of the
Scriptures that may have been in circulation could only have been
in the hands of a very limited number; while the languages in
which they were written were utterly unknown to the people, and
there were no translations. When all this is remembered it becomes
rather a matter of marvel that the sacred glow of Christian
truth survived so long in some places after the personal life that
kindled it ceased to be. Those were truly ages when Christian
witnesses were, and had to be living epistles known and read of
all men; for the personal life became practically the literature in
which the gospel was heralded. So the strength of a Church
depended mainly on the character and personality of the teachers.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the deadening influences around and in
the Gaelic Church of the Clyde districts subsequent to the period
of Patrick’s mission, we still mark in the sixth century the rays of
Gospel truth struggling there with the thick inclosing darkness of
Paganism. One heroic figure emerges from the surrounding
gloom. It is that of Kentigern, or Mungo, forever associated
with the origin and rise of the powerful commercial metropolis of
Glasgow. The traditions of his life abound with myths and
marvels; while his name has been a rich and suggestive theme
for the etymological fancy. From the romantic literature that has
gathered around his name, we glean what appears to be recognised
as generally accepted facts—that he was born at Culross, and that
he died at Glasgow about 601-3. He had been the pupil of the
famous St. Serf in the east in the northern boundaries of the
Brythonic race with Gaels to the north of them. So he may have
been a Highland or a Welsh Celt. One or other of the forms of
his name has been resolved, apparently with equal ease, into
either a Gaelic or a Welsh etymon. Perplexing or unsatisfactory
as this undoubtedly is it yet may suggest an explanation. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
happens in our own and other times his name would assume
various forms according to the dialects or languages of the speakers
and writers. The forms of his name, therefore, furnish no key as
to the race of his fathers.</p>

<p>When Kentigern began his labours on the Clyde the church of
St. Patrick’s people had lost much of its first love. Many of the
Gaels themselves had also been driven westward under Brythonic
pressure from the east and from the south. As Christian soldiers
or Milesians some had sailed to the north of Ireland to find a
home; others had drifted into Perthshire and Argyll, which at
this period became the true “<span lang="gd">Gaidhealtachd</span>,” or the “land
of the Gael.” Kentigern strove devotedly to revive the drooping
church. In his cold stone bed strewn with ashes on the classic
banks of the Molendinar stream he cultivated the spirit of prayer;
rehearsed the sacred strains of the psalmist; and warmed his spirit
by visions of divine fellowship. In the local sovereign of the
name of Morken he encountered much disagreeable opposition
and sarcastic interpretation of the saint’s faith in a Providence.
Kentigern virtually made an application for an ecclesiastical
establishment and endowment of himself and his presbyter followers.
King Morken received the application for temporalities in
a spirit that would do no discredit to a statesman of modern times.
He reminds the saint of his own popular saying: “Cast thy care
upon the Lord and he will care for thee.” But argued the King
further: “Now here am I, who have no faith in such precepts, who
do not seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness; yet for
all that, are not riches and honours heaped upon me?” The
royal granaries were full, while the Christian saints were starving.
How could he expect to believe in a Providence that thus
arranged the possessions of men. The saint’s replies and interpretations
proved unavailing with the royal sceptic, so broken in
heart the holy man retired to his oratory to pray. His emotions
were profoundly stirred; he began to weep. Then as the tears
started in his eyes and coursed down his cheeks, so did the waters
of the Clyde begin to rise and swell into a mighty flood, which at
last overflowed around the royal granaries, carrying them down the
stream, and leaving them stranded at the very door of the saint on
the banks of the Molendinar. The sanctity of his youth and the
faith of his mature years have been in this fashion richly attested
by miraculous manifestations, according to his rather credulous
biographer, Jocelyn.</p>

<p>The earnest and heroic labours of Kentigern were not confined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
to Strathclyde. We obtain glimpses of him beyond the Mounth
among the northern Picts of Aberdeenshire, while his Christian
fellow-worker and friend, Columba, was beginning to proclaim the
gospel in Perthshire. In his latter days we find him in Wales
where he founded the church of St. Asaph, and where he finally
died, leaving behind him a name whose holy influence has shed
lustre across the course of thirteen centuries.</p>

<p>Kentigern is peculiarly associated with the origin of Glasgow. In
the armorial bearings of this city we have perpetuated, according
to very remarkable legends, three remarkable miracles which were
wrought by the holy man, and which it would be probably unfair
to pass by without reference, considering that the sons of Gaeldom
ever since have helped and shared so very specially in the prosperity
of Glasgow. A pet robin redbreast, which belonged to the
college over which St. Serf presided, is represented on a shield
argent by a bird proper. This bird either through accident or
mischief was torn to pieces among the students. When the president
appeared to punish, young Kentigern, the best boy among
them, was made the scapegoat. The pieces of the bird were
thrown in his lap; but the hidden holiness of the boy was such that
the creature gathered up his limbs, flapped his wings, and sang a
joyous song on the approach of the holy master. On another
occasion Kentigern found his fire extinguished by his enemies; so
he was compelled to bring a tree from the frozen forest and breathe
into it the breath of fire. The remembrance of this feat is preserved
in the tree or branch which forms the crest. The figure of
a fish, with the ring in its mouth, recalls the scriptural reference to
the finding of a fish with the needed coin in its body. The biographer
of Kentigern, Jocelyn of Furness, knew well how to enrobe
his hero, with the help of the mythic accounts already
developed, with those miracles which had served sacred ends in the
lives of other saints at that period. Fishes with rings in their
bodies had always been found on critical occasions.</p>

<p>This brief sketch, in connection with the lives of Patrick and
Kentigern, of the Gaelic Christianity of Scotland in the fifth and
sixth centuries, will help to show forth in clearer outlines the work
of Columba. The spiritual forces that waved forth from Iona
were certainly not the first that brought religious light to the land
of the Gael. Nor were they so exclusively of Irish origin as they
are represented to be. In eastern Gaeldom in Scotland Christianity
had been already known. But in the course of the century
which elapsed from the time of Patrick it had greatly decayed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Columba came to the west of Scotland to revive and to proclaim
the faith afresh. He came back among his ancestral people from
the midst of whom the gospel had been sent a century previously
to Ireland. In Iona the religious centre of the land of the Gaels
was simply removed further west and north. The Gaelic-speaking
people themselves were drifting in the same direction towards the
Atlantic. As they themselves were largely absorbed by the
Brythons behind them, so they absorbed in their north-west progress
those brave non-Aryan clans to whom they became the
missionaries of the cross and the channels of letters. They extended
the area of Gaeldom, and imposed their Christian and
literary tongue on the conquered just as the Christian and more
literary Latin had been previously imposed on many of their own
ancestors. In the fourth century we mark gospel light in Strathclyde;
in the fifth we see it kindling on the shores of Ireland; in
the sixth it begins to burn from Iona.</p>

<p>It was among these South Albin Gaels at an early period that
we mark the appearance of Brigit: the Mary of the Gael. There
is no standard of Gaelic maintained in the orthography of this
proper name. <em>Brigit</em> is used here as one of the most ancient
forms; as also to preserve a chronological harmony with the
secondary significant title of “Mary of the Gael.” As we all know
the present form of the name is <em>Bridget</em> in English; but it has
been so little talked of in later ages by Gaelic Highlanders
that it becomes almost a serious matter for the majority of them
even to spell it in Gaelic. It is only in the compound “<i lang="gd">La-Fheill-Brighde</i>”—[Brìde]
or <em>The Day of the Feast of Bridget</em>, and surname
MacBride, that we are familiar with this female saintly name.</p>

<p>This by necessary phonological laws recalls <em>Brigid</em>, which in its
turn reminds us of the more ancient orthography <em>Brigit</em>, which is
adopted by Dr Stokes in his “Three Middle-Irish Homilies.”
Other Irish scholars have spelt it <em>Brigid</em>, even when they are
quoting from productions such as the poem ascribed to Brigit,
found in the Burgundian Library, Brussels, headed <span class="nowrap">thus:</span></p>

<p class="pad20pc noindent">
<em>Brighitt</em> (<span class="allsmcap">CCT.</span>)<br>
[Brigid (Cecinet)].</p>

<p class="noindent">The distinguished Stokes follows accurately the spelling of <i lang="gd">Leabhar
Breac</i>, <em>Brigit</em>. This is the form which we also find in “Cormac’s
Glossary” compiled originally nearly a thousand years ago. The
definition or explanation appended in Cormac’s work is suggestive
and instructive. “Brigit i.e. a poetess, daughter of the Dagda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
(doctus?). This is Brigit the female sage, or woman of wisdom,
i.e. Brigit the goddess whom poets adored, because very great and
very famous was her protecting care. It is therefore they call her
goddess of poets by this name. Whose sisters were Brigit the
female physician [woman of leechcraft]; Brigit the female smith
[woman of smithwork]; from whose names with all Irishmen a
goddess was called Brigit.” To this Dr Stokes adds that the
“name is certainly connected with the Old Celtic goddess-name
<em>Brigantia</em> as possibly with the Skr. Brhaspati and O. Norse Bragi.”
p. 23. This gives us a glimpse of a “female smith”; a “female
physician”; and a “female saint” (sanct Brigit) rolled into one,
and that one a goddess of Indo-European connections.</p>

<p>With these lofty associations and suggestions clinging to the
name of Brigit we almost find it difficult to descend to the regions
of ordinary earthly womanhood; and recognize in her a mere
Gaelic Christian maiden. Her name has never been absolutely
dissociated from the realm of myth, or rather <em>mythus</em>; but at the
same time we cannot help regarding her as a historical character.
Her name became celebrated very early wherever the Gaelic folks
did congregate. We find her name associated with King
Nectan of Albin, and with a church founded in her honour at
Abernethy. So her fame was not confined to the Gaelic regions
of Erin. That illustrious Scot, Patrick, a native of the district of
Strathclyde, is supposed to refer to her in his confession, where he
says, “There was one blessed Scottic maiden, very fair, of noble
birth, and of adult age, whom I baptized; and after a few days she
came to me, because, as she declared, she had received a response
from a messenger of God desiring her to become a virgin of Christ,
and to draw near to God. Thanks be to God, on the sixth day
from that, she with praiseworthy eagerness seized on that state of
life which all the virgins of God likewise now adopt.” These
notices help to bring us nearer what Carlyle calls the “actual Air-Maiden,
incorporated tangibility and reality,” whose electric glance
has fascinated the Gaelic world. It could not be expected that the
date of the birth of Brigit would be preserved; but when she became
a woman of consequence in the Gaelic or Scottic world her
movements began to be marked. The accounts of the fabulous
lives are very circumstantial; but sober-minded critics like O’Curry
are fairly satisfied with two principal dates, and most reasonable
folks will be the same. These two dates are Brigit’s advent at
Downpatrick on the 17th of March, 493, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; and her death in
525 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></span></p>

<p>The historical and fabulous lives of Brigit suggest a few interesting
questions which can only be hinted at in these remarks:—</p>

<p>1. Her conversion by the British Patrick to Christianity.</p>

<p>2. The probability that she belonged to a good British family
who, in the days of the Roman occupation, crossed to the nearest
Irish districts: (She is described as “of Kildare,” a county close
to the eastern shore).</p>

<p>3. And that she was a woman of exceptional character or culture,
which was possible in that century, under the perpetuated influences
of the Roman occupation.</p>

<p>That she and her people, like Patrick himself, were recent immigrants
to Ireland from Roman and Christian Britain, there
cannot be any serious doubt.</p>

<p>These may be the possible or probable facts ascertainable relating
to the life of the Mary of the Gael. But around them has
been woven a very interesting body of Gaelic literature which was
loved and cherished and cultivated for upwards of a thousand
years.</p>

<p>We have two ancient lives of Brigit, written on vellum; and
these are regarded as the oldest; and are attributed to St. Ultán,
whose death took place in the year 656. The <cite lang="la">Liber Hymnorum</cite>,
a production of the eleventh century is our authority for the information
that the “Life and Acts of St. Brigid of Kildare, were
collected and written by St. Ultán,” who was her successor in her
church, as Adamnan was that of Columba in Iona.</p>

<p>The two lives referred to are found in the <cite lang="gd">Lebar Breac</cite> and in
the Book of Lismore. A life written within the last two hundred
years on paper is also to be found in the Royal Irish Academy.
Her life is generally associated with the lives of Patrick and
Columba, as they also very appropriately are in “The Three
Middle-Irish Homilies,” edited by Dr Whitely Stokes, (Calcutta;
1877). In one of the so-called prophetic poems, a Norse Chief
Mandar, with a fleet, is represented as exhuming the body of Columba
which was afterwards buried “in Downpatrick, in the same tomb
with St. Patrick and St. Brigid.”</p>

<p>In the celebrated <cite lang="gd">Domhnach Airgid</cite>, one of the most ancient
relics of the old Gaelic civilization, we are presented with the
<em>figure</em> of Brigid.</p>

<p>Dr Petrie in his account of the relic says:—“The smaller
figures in relief are, in the first compartment, the Irish saints
Columba, Brigid, and Patrick.” Perhaps the most interesting
relic associated with Brigit is “a very ancient crozier, said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
belonged to <em>St. Finnbarr</em> (of Tormonbarry, in Connacht),—and
believed to have been made by <i lang="gd">Conlaedh</i>, the artificer of <em>St. Brigid</em>
of Kildare, early in the sixth century,” which is “now in the
Museum of the Royal Irish Academy.”.—<em>See O’Curry’s M.S.
Materials.</em></p>

<p>In early ecclesiastical annals Brigit is thus on the same platform
with Patrick and Columba in Gaelic Hagiology. True; her name
is not found, for instance, in the Benchor Antiphonary; but her
name is not unknown even in Latin Hymnology. The earliest
Latin poem that recognizes her is a fragment of three stanzas,
beginning with the letters X, Y, Z, respectively. It appears to
have belonged to an A B C Darian hymn of a somewhat biographical
nature.—[See <cite>Anecdota</cite> etc., 1713: Leabhar Imuinn: Dublin,
1855-1869.] The following Latin lines give us the earliest conceptions
of this “Mary of the <span class="nowrap">Gael.”:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ymnus iste angelicae</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Summeque sanctae Brigidae</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fari non valet omnia</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Virtutum miribillia</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quae nostris nunquam auribus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Si sint facta audivimus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nisi per istam virginem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mariae sanctae similem.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of this the following English rendering may be given:—
“This hymn, of the most angel-like and most saintly, Brigit is
unable to speak of all the marvellous works of power, such as we
have never heard of as been wrought, except through this virgin,
like unto the Holy Mary.”</p>

<p>The prevalence of Brigit’s name in Gaelic Hagiology is not
surprising, when we take into account her reputation for superior
powers of knowledge and wisdom. And this exceptional distinction
naturally suggests the question—Where could her superior
learning have been obtained? The writer thinks that it can be
clearly established that Brigit, like Patrick of Strathclyde, was a
fruit of Ninian’s celebrated monastery of Rosnat. Indeed,
there can be little doubt about this statement, although the
question has not been either put or answered hitherto. Philology
and history combine to make Brigit a native of that district known
first as that of the Brigantes, afterwards Bernicia, and later as the
Saxon Lowlands of Scotland. Professor Rhys thinks the folks
of this district in Brigit’s time were Celtic and largely Cymric:—“Thus
the term Bernicii would seem to have meant the people of
the Brigantian land, which, in this case, was mostly that of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
ancient Otadini, or Gododin of Welsh literature, together with a
part probably of that of a kindred people, the Dumnonii.” According
to the same learned authority <em>brigant</em> is phonologically
“the Gallo-Brythonic form of a common Celtic <em>brigant</em>, which,
with the nasal suppressed, we have in the Irish name Brigit (for
<em>Brigentis</em> of the I declension), St. Bridget or Bride. On the whole
then, Brigantes would seem to have meant the free men or privileged
race as contrasted with the Goidelic inhabitants, <em>some of
whom</em> they may have reduced under them.”</p>

<p>The Gaelic entries in the Book of Deer give us the name of
Brigit in compound forms, with which we are familiar. “<span lang="gd">Domnal
mac giric 7 mal <i>brigte</i></span>,” (<em>Domnal</em> son of Girec, <em>and Maelbrigte</em>).
In the old Gaelic genitive this term is “<span lang="gd">moilbrigtae</span>.” The Latin
rendering has been “<span lang="la">calvus Brigittae</span>;” similar to this is again
“<span lang="la">Servus Brigittae</span>,” or “<span lang="gd">Gillabrìghde</span>,” as found in the Four
Masters, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1146. And it ought not to be forgotten that as
Columba’s name has been perpetuated in that of the Clan Calum
so has that of Brigit <a id="tn-49">in Gaelic Scotland</a> been preserved in the
name of MacBride.</p>

<p>We have thus traced all that is actually known of Brigit in
philology and authentic history. But it is in poetry and fabulous
biography that her figure becomes haloed over with the interest of
romance and the veneration of ages.</p>

<p>Brigit herself was regarded as a poetess, and as we have already
seen, a MS. in the Burgundian Library has preserved a poem attributed
to her. This poem was probably the production of a
Gaelic bard of “the time of Aengus” <i lang="gd">Ceile De</i>; but the ascription
of it to Brigit recalls her poetic reputation; while its sentiments
reveal some of the inward life of the old Gaelic Church of Ireland
and Scotland. The first stanza runs thus in the <span class="nowrap">original:—</span></p>

<p>This production is peculiarly Celtic; and is remarkable in its
freedom from the growth of superstition which characterised the
Latin Church of the time. But it must not be supposed that the
old Gaelic Church was free from an external growth of a superstition
of its own. Indeed it set up rather a hagiology of its own
<a id="tn-50">in opposition</a> to that of Rome, so keen, like all the true Scots
that its members were, was its love of spiritual independence.
Patrick, Columba, and Columbanus, became its <i lang="la">Papae</i>, or Papes,
and Brigit herself its Virgin,—celebrated as the “Mary of the
Gael.”</p>

<p>Brigit was a very great and saintly personage to several of the
authors of the Gaelic Hymns in the <cite lang="la">Liber Hymnorum</cite>. Ultán of
Ard Breccain, who is said to have died in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 656, composed a
special “Hymn in praise of Brigit,” whose extravagant sentiments
and poetic power are but inadequately manifest in the following
<span class="nowrap">translation:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Brigit, excellent woman,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>In Colman’s Hymn she is as usual associated with “Patron
Patrick with Erin’s saints around him.” The blessing pronounced
on the sacred person of Brigit runs thus:</p>

<p>The chief poetic tribute to Brigit’s name is ascribed to Broccán

<p class="noindent">The life of Brigit printed by Dr Stokes from the Lebar Brecc, a
manuscript of the fifteenth century, occupies about eighteen printed
pages. Like Adamnan’s life of Columba it is largely taken up
with legends and traditional memories of miracles. Here is a
specimen of this standard Gaelic of the 15th <span class="nowrap">century:</span></p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="gd">

<p>Fecht and dorothlaig araile bannscal iressach codubthach condigsead
brigit lea amuig life. arbói comthinól senaid laigen and.</p>
</div>

<p>The passage beginning with this sentence is translated thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once upon a time a certain faithful woman asked Dubthach
that Brigit might go in with her into the plain of the Liffey, for a
congregation of the Synod of Leinster was held there. And it
was revealed in a vision to a certain holy man who was in the
assembly, that Mary the Virgin was coming thereto, and it was
told him that she would not be (accompanied) by a man in the
assembly. On the morrow came the woman to the assembly, and
Brigit along with her. And he that had seen the vision said
“This is the Mary that I beheld!” saith he to Brigit. The holy
Brigit blessed all the hosts under the name and honour of Mary.
Wherefore Brigit was (called) “the Mary of the Gael” thenceforward.</p>
</div>

<p>The last sentence in the original is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="gd">

<p>Conidhi brigit muire nangædel ósin ille.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Dr Stokes points out how this life of Brigit furnishes a good “example
of the way in which heathen mythological legends became
annexed to historical Christian saints.” He shows how the story
of Brigit, in many of its recorded incidents, belonged originally to
the myth or ritual of some goddess of fire. In proof of this the
following incidents in the life are referred to: Brigit was born at
sunrise; and her name, in cognate Sanskrit <em>Bhargas</em> is associated,
it is thought, with fire. Her birth takes place neither within nor
without a house. She is bathed in milk. Her breath revives the
dead. A house in which she is staying flames up to heaven.
Cowdung blazes in her presence. Oil is poured on her head.
The milk she is fed with comes from a white, red-eared cow. A
fiery pillar is seen rising from her head. Her wet cloak is supported
by sun-rays. And while she remains a virgin, she is yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
described as one of the two mothers of Christ the Anointed One.</p>

<p>Other authorities have described her as having perpetual ashless
fire, which was watched by twenty nuns, of whom she herself was
one, blown by fans or bellows only, and surrounded by a hedge,
within which no male could enter.</p>

<p>Various other interesting allusions, illustrative of the ancient
institutions of Gaeldom, are made in this life, such as the purchase
and sale of slaves, mulcts, (<em>eric</em>), witchcraft, dowry. We are also
reminded that leprosy once existed in Ireland; that Gaels practised
ale-brewing; that jewellery was in use; and that wattling was
employed for buildings.</p>

<p>But further discussion of these matters must be left to a future
volume. In the meantime, the writer’s best wishes for all who
hear of the name of Brigit, are that they may all be endowed with
the moral beauty, goodness, and dignity, which have been assigned
to the godly <em>Mary of the Gael</em>.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">NORTH ALBIN GAELS—COLUMBA.</span></h2>


<p>The presence of the Romans in Scotland produced very little
effect in the Highlands. Fringes of the eastern counties had been
occupied for brief periods of time; but the influence of Latin
civilisation was slight and transient. The Christian churches that
had begun to flourish in the Gaelic lowlands under Roman rule
showed signs of decay upon the withdrawal of the Imperial legions
which at first were a sort of protection to the somewhat feeble
Christianity of the earlier ages. The chief source of weakness to
this Christianity was the fact that it had not yet struck its roots
deeply into the independent soil of the native races. A more
virile gospel of natural native growth was needed. And this was
now about to be proclaimed by a man whose name is associated
with the most brilliant period and best aspirations of the history
of the Highland people.</p>

<p>This man was Calum, the son of Feidlimidh, son of Fergus, son
of Niall, of the “Nine Hostages,” monarch of Erin, who was
slain in the year 405. He was thus of blood-royal on the father’s
side; while his mother Ethne was also of a princely house. He
was born about the year <a id="err-54">521</a> at Gartan, in the county of Donegal.
His people in these northern Highlands of Ireland, belonged to
the same race that prevailed at this period in the southern Highlands
of Scotland; so in crossing the sea to the islands of Argyllshire
Columba merely sailed from one Gaelic country to another.
He was a man highly regarded in both countries on account of
his family connections among the powerful ruling races on both
sides of the sea. Before proceeding to detail the better authenticated
and the more suggestive events of his life, it may help to
remove some historical misconceptions and show more vividly the
field of Columba’s operations, if we glance at the condition of the
various races with whom he came in contact, and at their relations
to one another.</p>

<p>When the Highland people first emerge on the canvas of written
records within their present limits, it is in connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
proclamation of Christianity among them. We previously get a
glance of their valiant clans in the great national struggle with the
aggressive legions of Rome. The brave soldiers of these legions
with which the Caledonians strove, were in the main of the same
race as those to whom they were opposed. They belonged to the
powerful clan Chatti of ancient Batavia, the modern Netherlands,
where the Romans fixed their base for operations in Britain. It
was these Batavian Celts with their better weapons, and not Latin
soldiers, that fought the ancient Highlanders of the eastern counties.
Centuries passed after this great battle between the Celts of Albin
and those of Batavia who were in Roman pay. Then again the
clans of the north came distinctly into view when the star of
Christianity arose in the west. The sources of our information at
this point, are the uncertain references of classical writers on the
one hand—references which require careful sifting—and the vague
glimpses of native Christian writers on the other.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that these sources would supply us with
anything like a correct ethnological account. We may feel certain
that race theories in the sixth century were at least as confusing
and mistaken as they are in the present day even among fairly
educated people. So it is only by a careful induction and much
critical attention, that an approximation to the truth can be
arrived at out of those classical passages and sentences which have
been so severely tortured and twisted by Gaels and Goths, Brythons,
and Teutons. Much choleric temper has extended itself over
those ancient fields. In recent times sorely debated questions,
however, have changed faces, and historians have become more
humane. The Christ breath of the sentiment of human brotherhood
has very largely soothed the racial asperities with which the
wars of the Picts and the Scots have been fought again and again.</p>

<p>There is one phase of the history of those early centuries, which
he who runs may read now, and in which the Highland people
are naturally very much interested. It has come distinctly into
view as the result of able discussions during the last ten years.
The Celtic period of our national history used to receive very scant
attention indeed at the hands of the recognised writers on such
subjects. Our latest historians have shown a spirit of greater
fairness. The first volume of Burton’s “History of Scotland”
may be said to be devoted to the Celtic period; and, with the
exception of the writer’s evident anxiety to find the paternity of
the higher influences of civilisation in Teutonic fields, may be regarded
as a fair representation of the events of the centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
described. Even the publication of such a work as Skene’s “Celtic
Scotland,” bearing so suggestive a title, is a fact of much significance.
A learned if not always discriminating volume, “Celtic
Ireland,” by Dr Sophie Bryant, has also just been published.</p>

<p>In the fifth and sixth centuries we are confronted with a group
of races in north Britain which have formed the subject of bitter
and exhaustive controversies. The terms “Pict” and “Scot”
are the chief monuments of this fierce warfare. No one can pretend
to say now who the races are of whom these terms are the
exponents. They were bestowed on the people by outsiders, and
are quite unknown in the native literature of the country. It is
highly probable that they indicate personal characteristics such as
dress rather than race. The clans or tribes to whom they were
applied have been found all over north Britain and the north of
Ireland at different times. To translate them into native terms
will only make the confusion already existing more hopeless. To
render <em>Pict</em> by “<span lang="gd">Cruthnec</span>” would be as inaccurate as to render
<em>Scot</em> by “<span lang="gd">Gàidheal.</span>” The most helpful way in which we can
arrive at a fairly satisfactory conclusion at present is to take a brief
survey of the various races from a Gaelic standpoint; keeping the
main results of ethnological inquiry before our minds. From this
position the use of the terms “Pict” and “Scot” must be altogether
discarded. Let us examine the terms which the Gaelic
language <span class="nowrap">supplies:—</span></p>

<p>1. <i lang="gd">Albannaich.</i>—Who were or are the <i lang="gd">Albannaich</i>? The word
has come from Albainn or Albin, and is now generally used to
distinguish a Scotsman, whether Highland or Lowland, from the
<i lang="gd">Eirionnach</i> of Ireland and the <i lang="gd">Sasunnach</i> of England. The application
of Albion to the largest of these islands retreated in the
course of centuries to the north-west, where it still indicated the
presence of the pre-Celtic settlers who gave the name to the island.
The occasional application of it by Celtic writers to southern districts,
even as far south-west as the Isle of Wight, or the sea of
Ictis, prevailed as late as the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
<i lang="gd">Albannaich</i>, or people of a distinctively pre-Celtic character still
survived in the west, particularly in south Wales and Cornwall.
In the time of Columba the <i lang="gd">Albannaich</i> proper possessed and
ruled the country from Drum-Albin northwards. The language
they spoke is unknown.</p>

<p>2. <i lang="gd">Gaidheil.</i>—“<span lang="gd">Gaidheil Alba</span>” is an expression which indicates,
what we otherwise know, that the <i lang="gd">Gaidheil</i> were immigrants to the
country of the Albinians. The precise term for the land inhabited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
by themselves is “<span lang="gd">Gàidhealtachd</span>,” the application of which suggests
that it is a part or district of Albin. A similar expression
is “<span lang="gd">Gàidheil Eirin</span>,” which shows that Ireland is not more peculiarly
the land of the Gael than Scotland; indeed like “Scots” it
is only in the latter that <em>the</em> “Gaels,” emphatically “<span lang="gd">na Gàidheil</span>,”
can be found. When we first know them in north Britain we see
them in possession of the south-west Highlands and the Strathclyde
valleys. Their Gaelic tongue prevailed south of Drum-Albin, and
particularly in the fourth and fifth centuries, in that district or
county to which they have given its name, Argyll. They were
driven to Ireland in earlier times as well as into the Argyllshire
Highlands under the pressure of the Brythons on the south-east,
mixed up with, and supported by, the Romans and Roman rule.</p>

<p>3. <i lang="gd">Bretunnaich.</i>—At the time of Columba men of this race
pushed as far west as the Clyde. They have left a memorial of
their presence in that ancient capital of their rule, Dunbreton, or
Dumbarton. There were, no doubt, many Gaels still in the
district, although the Brythons asserted for some time a supremacy;
and the former reasserted their presence before the valleys
of the Clyde became finally Saxon in language.</p>

<p>4. <i lang="gd">Sasunnaich.</i>—In the land of the Gael very little was known
of the <i lang="gd">Sasunnaich</i> when Columba landed in Argyllshire. They
were well known to the <i lang="gd">Bretunnaich</i> on the eastern shores, where
they had for some time established themselves. But to the Gaels
in the west they were as yet a mere shadowy name.</p>

<p>Columba’s missionary enterprises were carried on among the
Gaels of the southern Highlands and the Albinians of the north-west.
The two languages in which he could freely and eloquently
preach were Gaelic and Latin, so among the Gaels he found himself
at once at home among a kindred people, many of whom had
already heard of Christianity. Among the Albinians of the north-west
neither his Gaelic nor his Latin could serve him; and he had
to engage an interpreter, who must have been familiar with Gaelic
and Albinic. With the Christianising of the north-west the area
of Gaelic speech extended, and Albinic gradually became extinct.</p>

<p>The advent of Columba on the shores of the Highlands constitutes
a new era in the national history. In the centuries which
elapsed from his time 553-97 to that of Queen Margaret 1057-93,
some 500 years, we have the truly Celtic period of Scottish national
life. In the course of the preceding 500 years the Romans
occupied large tracts of Scottish territory; and after the withdrawal
of their legions the Albinians maintained a powerful rule in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
north-west; so the Gaels had not as yet played so visible a part
on the national canvas. Now, however, with the evangelisation of
the country by Columba the Gaels, whose language became the
organ of sacred eloquence, appeared as the prevailing people.</p>

<p>The conclusions established by the following facts deserve distinct
attention in our conceptions of our national history:—</p>

<p>1. That the Gaels were the prevailing race in north Britain for
500 years previous to the reign of Malcolm Canmore.</p>

<p>2. That during these centuries the Gaelic language was used in
Court and church, and was the national speech of the people, even
when an English dialect began to develop on the east coast and
a Norse one temporarily prevailed in the western islands.</p>

<p>3. That a native Gaelic church flourished during this half
millennium.</p>

<p>4. That it was during these centuries that the permanent foundations
of our Scottish independence and nationality were laid, in
the midst of many fierce struggles and bitter sorrows, and by
means of many battles and much bloodshed. It was the Gaelic
conquests of this period that paved the way for the national throne
which Kenneth MacAlpine ascended, and which exercised sway
in the north until its power merged in that of the British Empire
upwards of a thousand years after the gospel was proclaimed by
Columba in the Hebrides.</p>

<p>The missionary advent of Columba, or in his own native language,
<em>Calum</em>, on the south-western shores of the Highlands constitutes
one of the earliest and chief dates of our national history.
The evangelical succession of his Christianity has been traced in
two directions. One source has been already touched upon, the
Church of Ninian from which Patrick went forth to evangelize the
north of Ireland. The mother home of this branch of Celtic
Christianity was undoubtedly Ninian’s celebrated monastery of
Rosnat, which is mentioned under several designations, of which
“Candida Casa” is the best known. Other names are the “Magnum
Monasterium,” “Alba” and “Futerna,” the latter being the
Gaelic equivalent for the Anglic “Whithern.” Abbots and bishops
trained in this renowned monastery laboured in Ulster; and
founded monasteries there. The last of this family of ecclesiastics
was Finian of the race of Dal Fiatach. This is acknowledged to
be the first channel through which Monachism was introduced
into Ireland, the personal links in the communication being Martin
of Tours and Ninian. The second channel, as well shown by Dr
Skene, was through Bretagne and Wales, the personal links in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
case being “David, Gillas, and Docus, the Britons,” otherwise
David, the patron saint of the Welsh, Gildas, the historian, and
Cadoc, the founder of Llancarvan in South Wales. Finian, an
Irish Pict, repaired to the monastery of Kilmuine, or Manavia, in
Wales, and became the pupil of these three distinguished men;
and on his return to Ireland founded in course of time the well-known
monastery of Clonard in Meath, the Gaelic <i lang="gd">Cluainerard</i>,
where no less than three thousand monks are supposed to have
been at one time under training. This became the source of
living Christianity in the south-west of Ireland after the time of
Patrick. Finian had twelve followers of celebrated name, who
have been designated the twelve Apostles of Ireland. Their
names run as <span class="nowrap">follow:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i>Ciaran</i>, the founder of the Saighir monastery in Munster.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ciaran</i>, called “<span lang="gd">Mac-an-t-Saoir</span>,” the “Artificer’s son,”
founder of Clonmacnois, in King’s County, in 548.</p>

<p>3. <i>Columba</i>, son of Crimthan of Leinster, founder of Tirrdaglas
in 548.</p>

<p>4. <i>Mobhi Clairenach</i>, founder of Glasnevin, in Fingall.</p>

<p>5. <i>Ninnidh</i>, of Loch Erne.</p>

<p>6. <i>Brendan</i>, of Birr.</p>

<p>7. <i>Brendan</i>, of the seven years’ voyage, founder of Clonfert.</p>

<p>8. <i>Laisren</i> or <i>Molaisse</i>, of Devenish.</p>

<p>9. <i>Ruadhan</i>, of Lothra.</p>

<p>10. <i>Senell</i>, of Cluain-innis.</p>

<p>11. <i>Cainnech</i>, of Achabo.</p>

<p>12. <i>Columba</i>, of Iona.</p>
</div>

<p>With the exception of Brendan of Birr, Cainnech of Achabo,
and the great Finian himself, who were of the Erinic race, all these
were of the Gaelic race.</p>

<p>Highlanders cannot help feeling much interested in the main
facts of Columba’s life. The exact date of his birth, ascertained
is fixed on the 7th of December, 521. He was baptised by the
Presbyter Cruithnechan, and the church of his youth was <i lang="gd">Tulach-dubh-glaise</i>,
now Temple Douglas, where his frequent attendance
procured him the title “<span lang="gd">Calum-cille</span>” or “Calum of the Church.”
In due time he became the pupil of Finnbarr, or Finian of Maghbile,
where he was ordained a deacon. He acquired taste for
general literature under the instruction of the bard Gemman. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
completed his academic training under Finian of Clonard, when
he became one of the twelve apostles of Ireland. In his religious
course of instruction the influences of the two British monasteries
of Candida Casa and Menavia met in the persons of the two
Finians, respectfully of Maghbile and Clonard. About the year
545 he founded the monastery of Derry, or of Daire, and afterwards
that of Raphoe in Donegal. Ten years after the date of the
foundation of the church of Derry he started the celebrated religious
centre of Durrow or <i lang="gd">Daire-Mag</i>, distinguished by the profusion
of oaks with which it was surrounded. Cennanus, or Kells, in
Meath, is also associated with his name, as well as a large number
of less famous churches scattered over many other counties.</p>

<p>This is the man who was about to Christianise the north-west
of Scotland, as well as give a fresh impulse to the great missionary
enterprises of the Celtic Church. Christianity was not altogether
unknown in the Western Isles before his arrival. The saintly
voyager, Brendan, one of his contemporaries, had been heard of
in these regions upwards of twenty years before the arrival of
Columba; and left traces of his presence in Bute and the Garvelloch
Isles, where his name has come down to us in that designation
of Rothesay folks, <em>Brandanes</em>, as well as in Kil<em>brandan</em>
Sound. He is also reported to have visited the island of Heth or
Tyree.</p>

<p>The departure of Columba from Ireland for the Scottish coast
was probably the result of mixed motives. He appears to have
been implicated in some sanguinary struggle, particularly the
battle of Culdremhne; how far it is impossible now satisfactorily
to ascertain. We are informed by Adamnan that the excommunication
pronounced by the Synod of Taillte in Meath was for pardonable
and trifling reasons. The silly story about the transcription
of the Psalter, and the judgment about the cow and its calf are
unworthy of the persons concerned and of the Christianity of the
period. The so-called sentence of exile does not bear the criticism
of common sense; and is the product of very credulous times.
That the heart of Columba yearned for the conversion of his
kindred across the sea is highly credible and natural. Political
motives may have entered into his thought; but we may generally
accept the impression of one of his biographers,—“his native
country was left by the illustrious saint and illustrious sage, and
son chosen of God for the love and favour of Christ.”</p>

<p>In the year 563 Columba, in the forty-second year of his age,
left Ireland for Scotland. The island of Colonsay was the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
soil on which he landed; but finding that he was still within eight
miles of Ireland he sailed further north to Ia or the <em>Iouan</em> island,
where he fixed his abode. He was accompanied by “twelve disciples,
his fellow soldiers,” in the fashion of the missionaries of the
Celtic Church who went forth in their twelves, sometimes in their
twenty-fours. At first on arrival at Colonsay these devoted brethren
thought they had sailed far enough from Ireland and raised
<i lang="gd">Carn cul ri Eirin</i>; but a clearer horizon soon revealed to them
their mistake. On the nearest elevation in Iona they raised a
similar <em>Carn</em> bearing the same title, and they were now satisfied
that they had sailed far enough north from their native place, the
vision of which could not tempt them to return. Had they been
able to anticipate the power of modern glasses they would find
that Ireland was still within their sight. The date of their arrival
in Iona was Whitsuneve, which that year fell on the 12th of May.</p>

<p>The name of Iona is a source of everlasting charm all over the
Christian world. Let us form to ourselves some conception of its
position, size, and character. In his voyage to this islet Columba
sailed by the fertile and low-lying shores of Islay, whence the high
lands of the north of Ireland can be easily seen in the hazy distance.
He landed on the lonely Colonsay, but stayed not there.
Further north he found his future home. This was that isle of
fame and beauty, situated at the south-west corner of the island of
Mull.</p>

<p>Iona is separated from the Ross of Mull by a channel about a
mile wide, in which the heavy swell of the ocean sometimes rolls
unkindly for tiny barks. This channel is deep enough for the
passage of the largest ships, but is not free from danger on account
of sunken rocks. The island itself lies north-east and south-west;
and is about three and one-half miles in length, and a mile and a half
in breadth. Its area is about two thousand acres, of which some
six hundred are generally under cultivation, the rest being either
pasture or barren. To see its northern end, as the writer first saw
it, gleaming under the morning sun,—its brows of sand flashing
their radiance afar,—produces an impression that does not readily
vanish. The diapason of the Atlantic and the responsive chorus
of the seashores help to charm and soothe while they solemnize
the human spirit. There truly you can find the spirit of nature’s
religion chanting lightly her morning hymns and rehearsing sweetly
her evening psalms. A plain extends from side to side, at the
narrowest part, in the centre of the island, with a small green
hillock in its centre. In this part of it the soil is fairly fertile; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
towards the north the ground becomes rougher with grassy hollows
and rocky rising-knolls which end in the highest point in the island,
Dun-I, 327 feet in height. From that eminence north a strip of
low land extends to the shore, terminating in a stretch of white
sand, which is composed chiefly of broken shells which the swell
of the ocean has rolled and wasted and worn together until it
heaped them there. Along the east side of the island the ground
is low-lying and fertile. South of the central plain the surface of
the soil is irregular, showing stony heights and grassy dells, which
afford good pasture. The shore abounds with little bays and
headlands. The underlying rocks are Laurentian, with an almost
vertical dip, and a strike from north-east to south-west. There are
beds of slate, quartz, marble, with serpentine, and a mixture of
felspar, quartz, and hornblende passing sometimes into a sort of
granite. This is the island of which the proverbial saying has
made Columba so tenderly sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0" lang="gd">“I mo chridhe, I mo ghràidh.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Isle of my heart, Isle of my love.)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The name of Iona has appeared under a large variety of forms.
The single capital letter I has stood for it, which pronounced like
double <em>ee</em> as Gaelic requires, represents the universal Gaelic pronunciation
for the island. Here are some of the other forms: Ia,
Ie, Ii, Ieoa; Hi, Hii; Y, Hy; Iona, Yona, Hyona, and Yensis;
I-Chalumchille and Icolmkill. In Adamnan it appears as the
<em>Iouan</em> island. This is an adjectival form in which the radix is Iou,
equivalent to the Gaelic I. Adamnan’s Iouan was corrupted by
the mistake of transcribers into the more euphonious Iona, an
explanation which shows, the untenableness of such fanciful
etymologies as <span lang="gd">I-thonna</span>, “the island of waves,” and <i lang="gd">I-shona</i>, “the
island of the blest.”</p>

<p>These were some of the peculiar developments of the Brito-Irish
Church from whose bosom Columba came. The monasteries
were usually located on grants of land, often very extensively made
by the provincial kings or other chiefs who had been converted to
Christianity, and desired to have the worship of God set up among
their people, and thus became identified with the clan or tribe in
which they were settled. It is in connection with these temporalities
that the remarkable functionary called Co-arb comes into view.
He appears to have been a person of greater consequence than the
bishop, and to have exercised ecclesiastical as well as temporal
power. Dr Todd defines his position and functions thus:—“On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the whole it appears that the endowment in land, which were
granted to the ancient church by the chieftains who were first
converted into Christianity, carried with them the temporal rights
and principalities originally belonging to the owners of the soil,
and that these rights and principalities were vested, not in bishops
as such, but in the co-arbs or ecclesiastical successors of those
saints to whom the grants of land were originally made. In other
words, the Co-arbs became the trustees of the temporalities of the
monasteries and of the missionary enterprises of the church. They
were the predecessors of those who in our own times hold property
in trust for our training schools, colleges, churches, and missionary
societies. There were no mines, docks, or railways in which shares
could be held; but the chieftain and his clan had real property at
their disposal which in their piety and generosity they set apart,
as occasion required, for the support of the gospel. The property
the earnest-souled monks soon transformed into a centre of holy
activity and Christian civilization.”</p>

<p>Columba with his family of Christian brethren in Iona, labouring
with hand and head; studying, writing, and praying; and sending
forth to neighbouring lands and islands Christian workers whose
hearts God had touched, formed a beautiful picture of pious effort
which deeply impressed the imagination of succeeding ages. This
band of ancient Gaelic Christians became known in course of time
under the endearing designation of “The Family of Iona.” The
goodly number of twelve disciples accompanied Columba to Iona,
the number being that usually sent forth together to labour in a
district in imitation of the accidental features of the apostolic
system. The names of the twelve brethren were Baithen, and
Cobthach, brothers; Ernaan, the uncle, and Diarmit the attendant
of Columba; Rus and Fechno, brothers; Scandal, Luguid, Eachaid,
Tochann, Cairnaan, and Grillaan.</p>

<p>Iona as a religious centre for the evangelising efforts of these
brethren was admirably situated. It was on the confines of the
Albinic and Gaelic jurisdiction. It was granted to Columba first
by Conall, King of the Gaels, who were largely Christians. The
great missionary also secured the grant by getting the approval of
King Brude of the Albinians, whom he visited soon after his
settlement at Iona. This visit to the king was paid at his fortress
at the mouth of the Ness, and was afterwards repeated several
times, which evinces the unchanging character of the friendship
which existed between the king and the saint.</p>

<p>The interesting story of Columba’s missionary labours in converting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
the Albinians and in reviving the drooping Christianity of
the Gaels belongs to the province of Church history and can only
be glanced at here as a fresh transforming factor which entered
deeply into the civil life of the people. It was no doubt the determining
influence in the historic process which ended in Kenneth’s
accession to the united throne in 843. Combined with the superior
knowledge of letters, this factor of Christianity facilitated the
Gaelic conquest of Albin. The struggle described in the popular
ballads of the Finians was a real one—in which the heathen and
decadent Féinne, the brave and chivalrous people of Ossian went
forth against the psalm-singing forces of Christian clerics, but they
always went forth to fall and die. The Gaelic and Christian
conquest of the Albinians or Féinne was complete with the union
of the two races in the ninth century. All through the struggle
the members of “The Family of Iona” played a prominent
part.</p>

<p>They had travelled north and east, earnestly labouring among
the various clans and tribes, and founding churches and colleges
which became not only Christianising but nationalising centres, and
so preparing the way for the extension of Gaelic rule. When the
proper opportunity came the nations were evidently well prepared
for a fusion which appears to have been very thorough.</p>

<p>Judging by the number of churches which they founded, and the
wide tracts of country over which their labours extended, the
Family of Iona must have had a very earnest and successful
brotherhood. The northern half of England was Christianised by
men who went forth from Iona, a fact which, it is pleasant to
notice, is specially acknowledged in the Dictionary of English
History recently published.</p>

<p>It is to the Family of Iona we are also indebted for the first
literary products to which we can refer. They were the first to
love and cultivate the literature which we now so highly prize. If
there were any such pre-Christian bards as Ossian, it is to the
ancient clerics that we are indebted for the preservation of their
compositions. Indeed it is a question whether the knowledge of
the forms of poetry existed at all in pre-Christian times. There
is no evidence <a id="tn-64">that we possess</a> a scrap of ancient poetry which
belongs to ages before Christian pens began to cultivate letters.
The brethren in Iona were much engaged in writing, which as an
accomplishment was considered as an adornment even for the
highest Church dignitaries. And great value was attached evidently
to the products of their pens. The transcription of sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
literature, particularly of the Psalter, occupied much of their time.
Columba himself was engaged in this work when death took him.
To be a ready <i lang="gd">scribhnidh</i>, or scribe, was an object of worthy ambition.
The position of <i lang="gd">ferleighin</i>, or praelector, was one of
honour in the sacred brotherhood. Many of the terms used by
them in connection with letters have come down to us; others
have been lost, or have since their time received different meanings
and applications. Columba’s Stylus, or pen, was called in Gaelic
<i lang="gd">graib</i>, from the Greek <i lang="la">graphium</i>; but the <i lang="gd">graib</i> of modern times
is an agricultural implement. A very poetic legend tells how this
stylus of Columba became the property of Gregory of Rome.
The leather cases in which the service books were kept for travelling
were called <i lang="gd">polire</i> and <i lang="gd">tiagha</i>. The alphabet they styled
<i lang="gd">abgiter</i> a form which has considerable philologic value; according
to one authority Columba’s <i lang="gd">abgiter</i> was written on a cake. These
waxed tablets for writing introduced <i lang="gd">ceir</i> from the Latin cera. The
library was <i lang="gd">teach screaptra</i>; and its keeper <i lang="gd">leabhor coimhedach</i>.
These and many other terms once current in Gaelic literature, introduced
by the Gaelic clerics in the British Isles and on the
Continent, ceased to be used in the centuries of greater ignorance
which succeeded their times.</p>

<p>In their ancient writings and lives occur many other terms
which have their value in shedding light on the social habits and
condition of the people. The family of Iona had their kitchen,
<i lang="gd">cuicin</i>, or <i lang="gd">coitchenn</i>; in which the coquina, <i lang="gd">coic</i>, or cook prepared
the meals of the brethren. Their chief season in the day time was
nona, or <i lang="gd">noin</i>, still occasionally heard in <i lang="gd">tra-noin</i>. Their cows
were sheltered in an outhouse, the Bocetum, or <i lang="gd">bathaich</i>; and in
the neighbourhood was the pasture-ground, or <i lang="gd">buaile</i>. The grain
was stored in the barn, or, <i lang="gd">sabhall</i>, the Gaelic term still in use.
They had also their Molendinum or <i lang="gd">Muileann</i>, in which the grain
was ground by the <i lang="gd">bra</i>, or quern. A caballus, a <i lang="gd">capull</i>, or <i lang="gd">gerran</i>,
was kept on the <i lang="gd">faithche</i>, or green enclosure near at hand to be in
readiness for general purposes. When they wanted to move
along the shores they had their curucae, or <i lang="gd">curraich</i>, whose light
frames covered with skins could so easily glide through the water.
For distant voyages and other purposes they had the scaphae, or
<i lang="gd">scadhan</i>, still applied to a certain class of boats. Visitors and
guests from far-off lands arrived in their barcae, or, <i lang="gd">barcan</i>, a term
still current in Gaelic. The Scologs, or lower order of the clergy
did not refuse to help the <i lang="la">Economus</i>, or <i lang="gd">fertighis</i>, the butler, or
<i lang="gd">pincerna</i>, or the baker, or <i lang="gd">pistor</i>. It is curious to find that on one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
occasion the baker was a stray Saxon. There were also among
the brethren in Iona a smith, or <i lang="gd">gobha</i>, and a brazier, or <i lang="gd">cerd</i>,
which in recent Gaelic has become a term of reproach. The term
for one article of their dress at least, <i lang="gd">cochall</i>, the Latin cuculla, had
survived in familiar Gaelic. It is represented that the hardy
brethren slept on the bare stones, and in their ordinary day clothes.
They were truly a <em>Milesian</em> or soldier race, who by their persistent
labours and self-sacrifices thoroughly deserved the name and fame
which after ages accorded them.</p>

<p>While the name of Columba is that which shines above all the
rest there were other labourers in the Highlands before, and contemporaneously
with him who have left behind them illustrious
memories, fragrant names which have entered very largely into the
nomenclature of the soil. Brendan has been already referred to.
Others like him made missionary journeys through the country,
such as the two Fillans, Flannan and Ronan, whose names are
commemorated in the Highlands and Isles. Moluoc became the
founder and celebrated patron of Lismore; and Kilmaluac in
Tiree has preserved his memory. His death took place in 592.
Maelrubha’s labours are chiefly associated with Wester Ross, but
he was honoured all over the Highlands. In 673 he founded a
church and college at Applecross where he laboured zealously till
he “rested,” as the chronicles say, in 722 in the eightieth year of
his age. He and Columba were the chief patron saints of Skye.
The north-eastern part of the island was peculiar to Columba, the
south-eastern to Maelrubha whose name survives in Kilmaree in
Strath, and in Kilmolruy in Bracadale. As far south as Islay we
find him venerated in the central parish of that Island, in Killarrow,
where he may have laboured on his way from Ireland before he
settled at Applecross. Another heroic character in the same age
was Donnan whose brave spirit and individuality have evoked
admiration throughout the whole of Scotland. He was younger
than Columba whom he regarded with ardent feelings of friendship,
and among whose Christian family at Iona he desired to be
enrolled. “This Donnan went to Columcille to make him his
soul’s friend; upon which Columcille said to him, I shall not be
soul’s friend to a company (heirs) of red martyrdom, and thy
people with thee. And it was so fulfilled.” In the far north his
figure emerges in <i lang="gd">cric Chat</i>, or “regions of Catt,” which included
Sutherland and Caithness. The parish bearing his name, Kildonan,
was the chief scene of his enterprise in the north. He closed his
life truly in “red martyrdom” in the island of Eigg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“To glorious martyrdom ascended,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With his clerics of pure lives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Donnan of cold Eig.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An account already quoted says—“Donnan then went with his
people to the Hebrides; and they took up their abode there, in a
place where the sheep of the queen of the country were kept.
This was told to the queen. Let them all be killed said she.
That would not be a religious act, said her people. But they were
murderously assailed. At this time the cleric was at mass. Let
us have respite till mass is ended, said Donnan. Thou shalt have
it, said they. And when it was over, they were slain every one of
them.” Another version runs thus: “Donnan the great with his
monks. Fifty-two were his congregation. There came pirates of
the sea to the island in which they were, and slew them all. Eig
is the name of that island.” In these west Highlands his memory
was preserved in Little Bernera, off Lewis, in South Uist, Loch
Broom, and Snizort, Skye, in each of which Kildonnans are found.
In the southern Highlands in Arran and Kintyre as well as in
Wigtonshire and Ayrshire we come across Kildonnans, or churches
dedicated to his memory. At Auchterloss in Aberdeenshire his
pastoral staff was preserved until it was broken by the Reformers.
His martyrdom took place on Sunday the 17th of April, 617; and
must have, along with that of the fifty-two brethren who were with
him, cast deep gloom on the prospects of Christian enterprise in
the West Highlands.</p>

<p>The journeys, the holy labours with their great results, of
Columba himself, and of his brethren from Iona, have been minutely
and eloquently described by various writers. The name of
the founder of Iona is associated with upwards of 60 religious establishments
or places in Scotland, and with as many in Ireland.
He died on the 9th of June, 597, seventy-six years of age. And
as we think of the memory which he left behind him for the veneration
of his countrymen we are reminded of the bright pillar that
was seen to glow upon his head on one occasion after reading the
Gospel in common with brethren from a distance, who visited him
in Eilein-na-Naoimh: “Brenden Mocu Alti saw, as he told
Congell and Cainnech afterwards, a ball of fire like a comet burning
very brightly on the head of Columba, while he was standing
before the altar, and consecrating the holy oblation, and thus it
continued burning and rising upwards like a column, so long as he
continued to be engaged in the same most sacred mysteries.” So
has the name of the saint burned and risen upwards like a monumental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
column upon the brow of Scotland. He has had a devoted,
<a id="tn-68">if an incredulous</a> biographer in Adamnan, his eighth
successor in the abbacy of Iona. To this writer we are indebted
for the most ancient piece of writing produced in the Highlands
that has been preserved. His name, which has undergone several
curious transformations, has been embalmed in the designations
of eight or ten places under the modifications of Teunan, Eunan,
Arnold, Avonia, and many. It has passed into personal names
of modern times in Gill-Adhamnain, or Gilleonan, borne by a
MacNeill of Barra in 1495. Adamnan was born in 624; succeeded
Columba in Iona in 679; and died on the 23d of Sept.,
704. His veneration and estimate of his great predecessor may
be gathered from the following eloquent sentences taken from the
preface of his interesting work: “From his boyhood he (Columba)
had been brought up in Christian training in the study of wisdom,
and by the grace of God had so preserved the integrity of his body,
and the purity of his soul, that though dwelling on earth he
appeared to live like the saints in heaven. For he was angelic in
appearance, graceful in speech, holy in work, with talents of the
highest order, and consummate prudence; he lived a soldier of
Christ during thirty-four years in an island. He never could spend
the space of even one hour without study, or prayer, or writing,
or some other holy occupation. So incessantly was he engaged
night and day in the unwearied exercise of fasting and watching,
that the burden of each of these austerities would seem beyond
the power of human endurance. And still in all these he was
beloved by all, for a holy joy ever beaming on his face revealed
the joy and gladness with which the Holy Spirit filled his inmost
soul.” Columba, notwithstanding the strong martial element of
his nature, was evidently capable of attaching disciples very
powerfully to his person. We find this illustrated also in the
legend preserved in the <cite>Book of Deer</cite> about his founding the
mission-station of Aberdour in Aberdeenshire: “<em>Drostan’s tears
came on parting from Columcille</em>. Said Columcille ‘Let Deur
(Deer) be its name henceforward.’”</p>

<p>Among the relics associated with the person of Columba is the
<span lang="gd">Cath-bhuaidh</span>, or <em>Battle-Victory</em>, a celebrated crosier. The following
passage from a legend of the ninth century reminds us of the
great veneration with which the relic was regarded, as well as of
the spirit in which his followers, three or four centuries after his
death, went forth to meet the enemies of their country. “About
the same time the Fortreens and Lochlanns fought a battle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Bravely indeed the men of Alba fought this battle, for Columkille
was aiding them; for they had prayed to him most fervently, because
he was their apostle, and it was through him that they
received the faith. One time when Imhar Conung was a young
man, he came to Alba, with three great battalions to plunder it.
The men of Alba, both lay and clerics, fasted and prayed to morning
to God and Columkille; they made earnest entreaty to the
Lord; they gave great alms of food and raiment to the churches
and the poor, received the body of the Lord at the hands of the
priests, and promised to do all kinds of good works, as their
clergy would order them, and that their standard in going forth
to any battle should be the crosier of Columkille. Wherefore it
is called the <i lang="gd">Cath-bhuaidh</i> from that day to this. And this is a
befitting name for it; for they have often gained victory in battle
by it, as they did at that time, when they placed their hope in
Columkille. They did the same on this occasion. The battle
was bravely fought at once. The Albinians gained victory and
triumph, killed many of the Lochlanns after their defeat; and their
king was slain on the occasion, namely, Ottir, son of Iargna. It
was long after until either the Danes or Lochlanns attacked them;
but they were at peace and harmony with them.”</p>

<p>Writers in after ages have attributed poems and prophecies to
Columba which such a good authority as O’Curry declares not to
be the productions of the Saint, whose chief literary functions are
associated with the transcription of the sacred writings.</p>

<p>In his Life of the Apostle of the Highlands, Dr John Smith of
Campbeltown, has given translations of some of the Latin poems
attributed to Columba; the following abstract exhibits their
<span class="nowrap">manner:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<span class="fs70 lsp">LATIN HYMNS OF THE CELTIC CHURCH.</span></h2>


<p>The following entry among the Irish Charters in the famous
Book of Kells illustrates the fate of much of our ancient Celtic
literature, especially in Scotland: “Anno Domini m<sup>o</sup> ui<sup>o</sup> (<em>alias</em>
1007). <span lang="gd">Soiscela mor coluim cille do dubguit is ind aidci as ind
iardom iartarach in daimliacc moir cenannsa</span>,” &amp;c. <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1006
(<em>alias</em> 1007)—The great Gospel of Calum-cille was sacrilegiously
stolen at night out of the western portions of the great church of
Kells. This was the chief relic of the west of the world on account
of the singular cover. This Gospel was found in twenty nights
and two months, with its gold stolen off, and a sod over it. Thus
the “great gospel” of Columba was preserved from destruction
by the merest accident. But cupidity has not been the only foe
that the Celt’s ancient manuscript literature has had to contend
with. The ignorance and indifference of many into whose hands
it fell have also played their part;—a tailor was seen last century
in the Hebrides cutting down Gaelic manuscripts for patterns.
More fatal than ignorance has been the active depreciation of a
hostile church operating on the animosity of a rival race. It is
only now—a thousand years after the era of the ancient Celtic
Church—that scholars and unprejudiced historians have succeeded
in showing us a little of it. The “sod over it” has been partly
removed; and the “find” has not been altogether uninteresting,
although the “gold” has been “stolen off.” Zeuss has furnished
us with materials for the reconstruction of the ancient Celtic language;
Skene and others have given us some account of the early
Iro-British Church; but Church history has not fully examined the
available existing material that would show us the character of the
Christian life and devotion of our early Christian ancestors in these
islands. It is proposed in the following chapter to glance at the
Latin Hymns of the ancient Celtic Church in order to realise to
ourselves a little of the inner life of those early evangelists to
whose extraordinary labours and unwearied zeal we are indebted
for the conversion of our forefathers from heathenism. In these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
hymns we have relics of that early religious literature which helped
to give Christian comfort to generations of lonely labourers on isle
and mainland. Here we have transmitted to us something of the
loving heavenly motives, the Gospel inspiration, by whose persuasive
force the strongholds of pagan darkness were pulled down
throughout the British islands, as well as in many districts on the
Continent.</p>

<p>These devotional compositions were the common property of
the whole Celtic Church at home and abroad. It is intended to
look at them here as remains of the use and wont which prevailed
during the “golden age” of this early Free Church, as it existed
in Scotland. In doing so, it may deepen our interest in them if
we briefly recall the historical setting and political surroundings in
which the great work of this Church was accomplished.</p>

<p>In order to reach the heart of this Church, we must pierce
through that belt of ecclesiastical and religious darkness which
Papal Rome wove round the body of our national life during the
four centuries <a id="tn-72">which preceded the</a> Reformation. Beyond these
centuries we are enabled at once to grasp that one outstanding
fact in our early annals, that from the days of Ninyas, in the beginning
of the fifth century, to the accession of the “Sair Saint,”
King David, in 1124 a Free Church, comparatively evangelical
and aggressive, existed in Scotland for a period of 700 years. No
definite attempt has been made to show the full national significance
of this fact. If we contrast that period of 700 years with
the following period of similar length, we find that during the first
half of the latter, decay and death prevailed; and that even during
the second half, with all the advantages attendant on post-Reformation
times, large tracts of our country, once aglow with gospel
life, remained practically heathen until the lost ground began to
be reconquered and reclaimed by the modern Free Church of
Scotland. In all this there is much to humble, instruct and
encourage us. We learn that the essential power of the gospel is
the same in all ages, and that similar results follow the earnest
proclamation of truth in ancient and modern times. The Christian
men that in early days made the gospel a living converting power
throughout our whole land, even in every village of the Highlands,
and every islet of the Hebrides, could not have been very unlike
their countrymen of the present day, among whom evangelical
truth is preserved and preached.</p>

<p>A glance at the early history of Ireland reveals the fact that a
similar course of things took place there. Pope Adrian IV.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
known to England as Nicolas Breakspere, the only Englishman
who ever sat in the chair of St. Peter, issued a bill in 1155, giving
the kingdom of Ireland to Henry II. of England. This is a remarkable
fact, and deeply suggestive in connection with the
reasons assigned for its accomplishment. The Irish had all along
been Protestants against Rome and her rule. The Pope, who
like all the bishops of that holy ilk, claimed the right to dispose
of all Christian lands, finding that the Irish, according to Roman
estimate, were “Schismatics” and “bad Christians,” like their
brethren of the same period in Scotland, made a present of the
island to Henry, in order to make good Catholics of the inhabitants.
Here were two Englishmen engaged in perverting, or rather
completing the perversion of the Free Independent Church of
Ireland to Rome. Hence all the tears of Ireland, England’s great
responsibility, much bloodguiltiness on all sides, the almost utter
futility of all attempts to restore to that much-enduring isle, the
comparatively pure faith of its ancient days. O’Driscol, an honest
Roman Catholic writer, describes the change as follows:—“There
is something very singular in the ecclesiastical history of Ireland.
The Christian Church of that country, as founded by St. Patrick
and his predecessors, existed for many ages free and unshackled.
‘For above 700 years this Church maintained its independence.’
It had no connection with England, and differed upon points of
importance with Rome. The work of Henry II. was to reduce
the Church of Ireland into obedience to the Roman Pontiff.
Accordingly, he procured a Council of the Irish clergy, to be held
at Cashel in 1172, and the combined influence and intrigues of
Henry and the Pope prevailed. This Council put an end to the
ancient Church of Ireland, and submitted it to the yoke of Rome.
‘That apostacy has been followed by a series of calamities, hardly
to be equalled in the world.’ From the days of St. Patrick to the
Council of Cashel was a bright and glorious era for Ireland. From
the sitting of this Council to our time, the lot of Ireland has been
unmixed evil, and all her history a tale of woe.”</p>

<p>The influence of Rome on the heart of the Scottish nation, began
with the marriage of Malcolm with the English Roman Catholic
Princess Margaret. This Saxon queen completed the outward
perversion of Scotland to Rome. She pretended to reform, but
only managed to enthral the native Church, whose clergy she
summoned to a Council in 1074. The Gaelic language was the
only language the clergy could speak—they had a professional
knowledge of Latin—so King Malcolm, her husband, acted as her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
interpreter. They refused to recognise the absolute supremacy of
the great Roman father; they were unable to speak English; and
the queen set herself piously to rectify these abuses and shortcomings.
The Roman Catholic influence of the Norman went on
increasing until the Court, as the Celtic Professor at Oxford says,
“in the time of David, who began to reign in 1124, after being
educated in England in all the ways of the Normans, was filled
with his Anglican and Norman vassals. He is accordingly, regarded
as the first wholly feudal King of Scotland, and the growth
of feudalism went on at the expense of the power and influence of
the Celtic princes, who saw themselves snubbed and crowded out
to make room for the king’s barons, who had grants made to them
of land here and there, wherever it was worth having. The outcome
was a deep seated discontent, which every now and then
burst into a flame of open revolt on the part of the rightful owners
of the soil.” The Celtic Church died away with the decay of the
power of the Celtic princes. At the same time the Roman religion
was warmly supported in the persons of Englishmen, Flemings
and Normans, who received every encouragement to settle in
Scotland. The predominance of the Celtic element seems to have
passed away in the eleventh century. “At the time, however, of
the War of Independence, Gaelic appears to have still reached
down to Stirling and Perth, to the Ochil and Sidlaw Hill, while
north of the Tay it had as yet yielded to English or Broad Scotch,
only a very narrow strip along the coast.” The bulk of Bruce’s
army at Bannockburn was composed of the Ivernian and Celtic
descendants of the ancient Free Church of Scotland. The true
Christian devotion of the Fathers had not altogether disappeared:
like the Puritan soldiers of Cromwell these grand old Scots began
the grim work of battle for national freedom, with a fervent prayer
to the God of battles,—a species of homage which surprised the
more Catholic English.</p>

<p>The Latin hymns of this <a id="tn-74">ancient Church</a> will be found in the
“<span lang="gd">Leabhar imuin</span>” (Book of Hymns) and the Bangor Antiphonary,
both miscellanies of odes, canticles, blessings, prayers, &amp;c.
Altogether the number is upwards of thirty. The “<span lang="gd">Leabhar
imuin</span>” is a MS. of the ninth or tenth century in Trinity College
Library, Dublin, of which two thirds have been printed. The
first part, edited by the late Dr Todd, appeared in 1855, and contained
the following four hymns, with extensive annotations from
the “<span lang="gd">Leabhar Breac</span>,” &amp;c.:—1, The Hymn of St. Sechnall in
praise of St. Patrick; 2, The Hymn of St. Ultán in praise of St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Brigit; 3, The Hymn of Cummain Fota in praise of the Apostles;
4, The Hymn of St. Mugint. These are specimens of the terminology
of the hymn titles.</p>

<p>The Bangor Antiphonary is a MS. in the Ambrosian Library,
Milan. It was written between 680 and 691; and was printed by
Muratori in 1713. Some of the pieces in this MS. have a historical,
as well as a devotional value, such as “The Versicles of the
Family of Benchor,” and “The Commemoration of our Abbots,”
in which the names of fifteen abbots of the Bangor (County Down)
monastery are given in the same order in which their obits occur
in the annals. Dr Reeves speaks well of its accuracy, considering
that the MS. has been some 1200 years absent from Ireland.
These are the sources in which this Latin hymnology of the ancient
Gaels will be found. They are not very accessible. As already
remarked, versions of them will be also found in the “<span lang="gd">Leabhar
Breac</span>;” some of them were printed by Sir James Ware, in the
appendix to his “<span lang="la">Opuscula S. Patricii</span>;” while the Isidore Codex
of the “<span lang="gd">Leabhar imuin</span>” recently brought from Rome to Dublin,
has never yet been printed. These MSS., written in a peculiar
ornate style, have become known to archæologists under the description
“<span lang="la">libri Scottice Scripti</span>,” (books written in Scotch).</p>

<p>Some of these devotional compositions are as old as the fourth
century, such as the “<span lang="la">Hymnum dicat</span>” ascribed to Hilary, and
the “<span lang="la">Mediæ noctis</span>,” ascribed to the famous Ambrose of Milan.
The “<a id="tn-75"><span lang="la">Audite Omnes</span></a>” was composed by Sechnall, the nephew of
Patrick, towards the close of the fifth century, in praise of the Irish
apostle. This piece, rather a poem than a hymn, bears to have
been written “in <span lang="gd">Domhnach Sechnaill</span>,” (now Dunshaughlin in
Meath), by the St. Sechnall, or Secundinus, who was a son of
Patrick’s sister, “by her husband <em>Restitutus</em>” of the “Longobards
of Leatha.” The superscription reminds us of the fact that the
Scots and the Gaidels were the same people, whether found in
Ireland or parts of Britain. It runs thus: “<span lang="la">Incipit Ymnus sancti
Patricii episcopi Scotorum.</span>” (“The hymn beginning, St. Patrick,
Bishop of the Scots.”) The following note on it occurs in the
“<span lang="gd">Leabhar Breac</span>”: “<span lang="la">Tempus autem.</span>” (“But the time”);—viz:
“when Leogaire, son of Niall, was King of Eirinn came
to praise Patrick. Sechnall said to Patrick, ‘When shall I make
a hymn of praise for thee?’ Patrick said, ‘I desire not to be so
praised during my life.’ Sechnall answered, ‘<span lang="la">Non interrogavi
utrum faciam, sed quando faciam.</span>’ (‘I did not ask whether I
should do it, but when’). Patrick said, ‘<span lang="la">Si facias venit tempus.</span>’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
(‘If you do it, the time has come’)—i.e. because Patrick knew
that the time of his (Sechnall’s) death was at hand.” In the third
verse we have the old Scottic interpretation of the famous passage
in Matthew on which St. Peter’s chair is <span class="nowrap">founded:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Constans in Dei timore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et fide immobilis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Super quem aedificatur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ut Petrum Ecclesia.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Constant in the fear of God, <a id="tn-76">and immovable in</a> faith, upon him
as upon a Peter is built a Church.”</p>

<p>The student of these ancient writings is surprised to find the
modern Irish persist in making Patrick a Frenchman. In the
“<span lang="gd">Leabhar Breac</span>” the following note, as decisive of his nationality,
occurs in connection with this hymn. “<span lang="la">Patraic umorro do
bretnaibh h ercluaide a bunadus.</span>” “Now Patrick in his origin
was of the Britons of Er-Cluaide”—i.e. of the Strathclyde Britons,
among whom his name has found its topographical monument in
Kilpatrick, as already pointed out.</p>

<p>The ancient Christian Scots had their own saints, to whom they
were naturally attached as the fathers of their Church. The names
of Patrick, Columba, and others, as well as of Brigit constantly
occur in these Latin Hymns. Brigit comes next in importance
to Patrick in Hibernian hagiology. Ultán’s hymn
in praise of her begins with these words, “<span lang="la">Christus in nostra insola
que uscatur hibernia;</span>” and towards the end, the “angelic and
most holy Brigit” in all her wondrous works of power, is spoken
of as “like unto the holy Mary.” We have only fragments of this
poem. It appears to have been originally composed, like Sechnall’s
and several others in these MSS., in the A B C style, with
a stanza for each letter of the alphabet. There is another found
in the beginning of an old Celtic copy of the Greek Psalter, in
praise of Brigit, whose feast day is also celebrated in another,
“<span lang="la">Phœbi diem.</span>” The feast day of Patrick has also its celebration
hymn, beginning thus: “Lo, the solemn feast day of Patrick is
shining most brightly.”</p>

<p>The hymn “<span lang="la">In Te Christe</span>” is one of the three attributed to
Columba, and bears in some places the stamp of his majestic spirit.
The “<span lang="la">Ignis Creator igneus</span>” starts with the conception of the
Paschal candle, and proceeds to describe the columns of smoke
and flame which guided Israel out of Egypt. A few of the metrical
compositions in the Bangor Antiphonary have a more local
and historical than a devotional interest, such as the “Good Rule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
of Bangor,” and the commemoration of the abbots of that place,
already referred to. The name of Comgall, the head of the monastery,
who died in 602, occurs, as also Molaisran, or Molio of the
Holy Isle, Arran, who died in 639. There is an evening hymn
beginning with “<span lang="la">Christe qui Lux es</span>” and a Pentecostal one about
the Apostles, with the initial words “<span lang="la">Christi, Patris in dextera.</span>”
There is one hymn, and only one, in the group in praise of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, “<span lang="la">Cantemus in omni die.</span>”</p>

<p>Metrical translations of seven, in whole or in part, of these
hymns are given here, to indicate the general character of the devotional
portions of the group. The one beginning with the words:
“<span lang="la">Precamur Patrem</span>” has not had any date assigned it, but judging
by internal evidence, it appears to belong to the era of Patrick.
It contains one hundred and sixty-eight lines; starting with an
address to the Lord’s Day, it proceeds to give an abstract of the
life of Christ. A comparison made between the beginning of the
physical and that of the spiritual creation, is worked out in somewhat
original fashion. In the following verses the Lord and His
Own Day are contrasted as the first-born children of light:</p>

<p>A remarkable composition, probably belonging to the same
period, and intended to be used on the birthdays of the martyrs
has, like a few others, the refrain “Alleluia” introduced after every

<p>There is a hymn by another author of Welsh extraction, St.
Mugint, in the “<span lang="gd">Leabhar imuin</span>,” beginning with the words “Parce
dne.” The “Altus” of Columba, who arrived in Scotland from
Ireland in 563, is a production of considerable length and much
merit, in the A B C Darian style. It takes cognisance of the
whole sphere of sacred and Scriptural truths, somewhat in the
fashion of the compositions of the Brytho-Saxon Caedmon, and has
been regarded as a highly effective <span class="nowrap">“Lorica”:—</span></p>

<p>There is a Gaelic hymn attributed to Columba, which illustrates
the manner and occasions of using these “<span lang="la">Loricae</span>”—in Gaelic
<i lang="gd">lurech</i>. Its superscription runs thus: “<span lang="la">Colum cilli cecinit</span>, while
passing alone; and it will be a protection to the person who will
repeat it going on a journey.” The author in the first verse represents
himself as lonely on the hillside, and addressing the royal
“Sun.” <span lang="gd">M’oenuran dam is in sliabh</span>, <span class="nowrap">&amp;c.:—</span></p>

<p>The <i lang="gd">rig-grian</i>—Sun-king, is applied to the Creator.</p>

<p>The third Latin hymn ascribed to Columba, and beginning with
the words “<span lang="la">Noli Pater</span>” is also a “<span lang="la">Lorica.</span>” It is connected
with the lighting of fires on St. John’s Eve. In some prefatory
remarks, its virtues are thus described:—“It is sung against every
fire and every thunderstorm, and whosoever sings it at bedtime

<p>Much is made of the elements in this composition. In the
Gaelic one already referred to, Columba guards in the last verses
against any tendency to Pantheism that might be connected with
his expressions. He declares:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I adore not the voice of birds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor the <i lang="gd">sreod</i>, nor a destiny, or the earthly world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor a son, nor chance, nor woman;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My Druid is Christ, the Son of God,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christ, the Son of Mary, the Great Abbot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My estates are with the King of kings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My order is at Cenannus and Moen.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Cenannus</em> is now Headfort in Meath, where Columba erected a
monastery. <em>Moen</em> is now Moon, in Kildare.</p>

<p>The renderings of hymns given in the preceding paragraphs will
convey some idea of the hymnology of the Gaelic Church. The singing
of these Latin compositions awoke echoes for ages along the glens
of Gaelic Scotland as well as in the forests of Germany; among
the Swiss and Italian Alps, as well as along the sweet hills of
Devon and Cornwall. They indicate a practical literary activity
which served well its generation; and frequently helped to soothe
the relentless spirit of revenge of the Pagan nations of the period.</p>

<p>The primitive Free Church of the Gaels of Britain was an important
branch of this powerful missionary Church of the Celts.
Its operations and results were largely obscured by successors
on the same fields who departed from its methods of work; but
recent efforts of impartial investigators, have helped to assign it its
proper place in the ancient Christianization of Western Europe.
It does not lie within the scope of this work to discuss the character
of the organization of this Church of the Gaels. Indeed the
question has been already so thoroughly investigated by competent
pens that it would be perfectly superfluous to attempt it. To the
literary student this period of church history is chiefly interesting
on account of the fact that it is through the hands of these devoted
workers of those ages that the first fruits of written literature have
been handed down to us. These men being our earliest literary
artists, we naturally turn with perennial interest to the Christian
organizations which some had founded, and in which others were
bred.</p>

<p>A small production, some three quarto pages in prose, gives us
a picture of a holy brother who might be expected to cultivate the
virtues of the Gospel in solitude rather than in the circle of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
active community. It is called the “Rule of Calumcille;” and
has been found in the Burgundian Library of Brussells. The
Rule recommends residence close to a church; a fast place with
one door; the company of one attendant only, whose duties must
be light; and access to be granted only to those whose converse will
be of God and His Testament. The time is to be spent in prayers
for those taught and for those dying in the faith. The day is to
be divided into three parts, one for prayers, for good works, and
for reading respectfully. The work is to be divided into three
parts; the first for his own benefit in doing what is needed for his
own habitation; the second for the good of the brethren; and the
third for that of the neighbours. The work of benefiting his
neighbours to consist in giving precepts, writing manuscripts,
sewing clothes, or any other profitable industry. The great end to
be obtained is that there “be no idleness;” “<span lang="la">ut Deus ait: non
apparebis ante me vacuus.</span>”</p>

<p>This sentiment of “no idleness” is highly creditable to the
ancient Gaelic Christian communities; and if we combine with it
another found in one of the lives of <span class="nowrap">Columba,—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“He drank not ale; he loved not satiety:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He avoided flesh;”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we make a clean discovery which absolutely refutes the unneighbourly
charges of more southern brethren in our own time which
associate Celts, whisky, and idleness too closely and unfairly
together. Our early Highland teachers inculcated industry and
sobriety; the dangerous powers of whisky were unknown to them;
and even the lighter inspirations of ale they eschewed until their
own primitive virtues were undermined by contact with the beer-drinking
Pagan Norse on the one hand, and in later times with the
fiercer spirits which were imported from Teutonic fens on the
other. Such are the strange reversals of popular opinions which
accurate study of the facts of history unfolds. The alleged idleness
of the Gael of the present day, does not appear thus to have
any essential connection with the original sin of the race; the
development of the quality appears to have taken place in contact
with a more sluggish and a less lively people.</p>

<p>In his great work on “English Writers,” Professor Henry
Morley writes:—“When darkness gathered over all the rest of western
Europe, the churches and monasteries of the British island, first
among the Celts and afterwards among the English, supplied, says
the Danish scholar [Professor Sophus Bugge], in and after the
seventh century, the only shelter and home to the higher studies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
The British clergy travelled far in search of books, until in the
time of Charlemagne it was from the Church in Britain that the
clearest light shone through the western world.” The devotional
spirit by which these men were animated, will be fairly illustrated
by the renderings of their Latin Hymns contained in this chapter.</p>

<p>It is freely acknowledged that the ancient Free Church of the
Scots, even in its golden age, held and practised peculiar tenets
which in course of time developed undesirable and even unscriptural
fruit. On the other hand, it must be allowed that it adhered
for a long period to the main doctrines of evangelical Christianity.
From the hymns which we have been considering, and from
Patrick’s “Epistle of Coroticus,” and his “Confession,” in which
we have something of the nature of a creed or a confession of
faith, as well as from other sources, we gather a fair representation
of the chief dogmas of its faith. It held and taught the chief
doctrines of the Trinity, of the incarnation, death, resurrection, and
ascension of Christ, and of His coming again at the last day to
judge all men; and likewise of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
to make us sons of God, and heirs of immortality. It held, moreover,
the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God, and used them
freely and exclusively as the authority by which all statements of
doctrine are to be proved and confirmed. At the same time the
doctrine of human merit, purgatory, saint-worship, transubstantiation,
papal infallibility, and other distinctive tenets of modern
Romanism, find no recognition. While, as we are told by St.
Bernard, its followers “rejected auricular confession as well as
authoritative absolution, and confessed to God alone, believing
God alone could forgive sins,” they would neither give to the
Church of Rome the tenths, nor the first-fruits, which of course
rendered them “schismatics and heretics” at Rome. Marriage
was regarded as a civil rite, and was performed by the magistracy.</p>

<p>The purity of doctrine and generally healthy influence cultivated
and exercised by the ancient Celtic Church, are shown in a remarkable
manner in the products of Celtic art, which attained to
its highest development in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries.
The remains of this school of ancient sculpture, if collected
into one national museum, would form an exhibition of native art
such as, according to Mr Joseph Anderson, the Rhind lecturer, no
northern nation can boast of. Respecting these sculptured stones,
memorials that are not unworthy of our valiant Christian ancestors,
Burton, in an interesting chapter, remarks: “It deserves to be
commemorated that in the hundreds of specimens of native sculpture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of this class recently brought to light there is no single instance
of indecency, while in the scanty remains of Roman art within the
same area it would be easy to point out several.”</p>

<p>The character of the two races that blended into one through the
agency of this Church and outward political pressure is not unfairly
represented by Professor Rhys, when he says, touching first
on the Gael or ancient Scot: “One of the lessons of this chapter
is that the Goidel, where he owned a fairly fertile country, as in
the neighbourhood of the Tay, showed that he was not wanting in
genius for political organisation; and the history of the kingdom
of Scotland, as modelled by Kenneth mac Alpin and his descendants,
warns one not to give ear to the spirit of race-weighing and
race-damning criticism that jauntily discovers, in what it fancies
the character of a nation, the reasons why it has not achieved
results not fairly placed within its reach by the accidents either of
geography or history.” The other ancient race of Albin was
neither Celtic nor Aryan in its origin. It has been generally known
as Pictish, and constitutes the backbone of the Scottish nation.
Mr Rhys calls it <em>Ivernian</em>. The following sentences state a fact
and describe a process: “The trouble the non-Celtic Picts were
able to give the Romans and the Romanising Brythons has often
been dilated upon by historians, who have seldom dwelt on the
much more remarkable fact, that a power, with its head-quarters
in the neighbourhood of the Ness, had been so organised as to
make itself obeyed from the Orkneys to the Mull of Cantyre, and
from Skye to the mouth of the Tay, so early as the middle of the
sixth century. It is important to bear this in mind in connection
with the question as to how far the earlier Celtic invaders of this
country may have mixed with the ancient inhabitants; since it
clearly shows that there was no such a gulf between them as would
make it impossible or even difficult for them to amalgamate; and
it may readily be supposed that the Goidelic race has been greatly
modified in its character by its absorption of this ancient people
of the Atlantic seaboard.” The Latin hymns considered here are
the remains of the devotional literature of these two races, and
bind the history and memories of modern Scotsmen to the history
and memories of a people among whom the fervid national genius
of Scotland was first fashioned.</p>

<p class="p1">It has been well remarked that each of the literatures of the
two branches of our Celtic population was chiefly the utterance of
feeling stirred by a great struggle for independence, and that each
has at the heart of it “a battle disastrous to the men whose wrestle
with an overmastering power is the chief theme of their bards.”
The Gaelic struggle and literature began earlier, and its great
battle is that of <i lang="gd">Gabhra</i>, said to have been fought in 284 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> In
the later Celtic literature of the Cymri the memorable battle described

<p>While <i lang="gd">Cath Gabhra</i> is the chief theme of the Gaelic bards, individual
combats, adventures, and other battles are also rehearsed
in the early ballads.</p>

<p>Macpherson’s “Ossian” and Smith’s “Old Lays,” whose authenticity
has been so fiercely disputed, are excluded from consideration
at present. They will be afterwards examined under the
dates of their production. The number of lines in these works
and other two poems respectively <span class="nowrap">is:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Laying aside these 16,829 lines of suspected poetry, there is still
the 54,000 lines of ancient poems of unquestioned genuineness in
Campbell’s “<span lang="gd">Leabhar na Féinne</span>,” enough surely to sustain the
literary character and genius of our early ancestors.</p>

<p>The ballads which we are now to consider are all genuine and
old, and may be found in manuscripts written ages before Macpherson
was born.</p>

<p>The Ossianic or Heroic Ballads will be found in the following
publications:—The Dean of Lismore’s Book (1512, published
1862); Hill’s (1780); MacArthur’s (1784); Young’s (1784);
Gillies’s (1786); Stewart’s (1804); Highland Society’s Report
(1805); Turner’s (1813); Grant’s (1814); MacCallum’s (1816);
Campbell’s great work (1872). Some of the ballads contained in
these books were printed from old manuscripts; others were taken
down during the last two or three centuries from the oral recitation
of old men, living in all parts of the Highlands.</p>

<p>These collections represent a good deal of industry and literary
activity, which reflect very creditably on men who had not the
stimulus of a vast reading public to work upon their minds.</p>


<h3>THE GENUINE GAELIC BALLADS.</h3>

<p>The place in time occupied by these compositions is one of
<a id="tn-88">considerable length</a>—it extends at least as far back as the third
century of our era. It is very interesting to note that this body
of oral popular literature has been loved, preserved, and rehearsed
by the Gaelic clans of Albin for at least a thousand years; for a
much longer period, indeed, if we rely on fairly credible tradition.</p>

<p>The inter-tribal struggles described in these ballads—the patriotic
resistance against the Norse attempts to obtain the supremacy,
mixed up as they are with the encroachments of Christianity within
the realms of heathenism—took place mainly within the Albinic
area. The geographical limits of this area in those early times
were very vague and shifting. In a general way they may be said
to have embraced the Western Islands, the North-west, and part
of the central Highlands, as well as the Isle of Man and Ireland.
Over all these regions we watch in these ballads the shadowy
movements of our brave ancestors. We hear the faint echoes of
their names, and the fame of their deeds, the war-cries and voices
of their almost semi-mythic heroes.</p>

<p>We regard the tribes whose deeds are celebrated in these productions
under two classes—those of the Cruithne or Albinic race<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
and those who have become known as the Scottish Iro-Gaelic race.
At that period there were Cruithne or Picts in Erin as well as in
Albin.</p>

<p>Previous to the arrival of Patrick in Ireland and to that of Columba
in the Highlands, there is strictly speaking no chronological history
of either country. Of the earlier movements of the clans and their
battles we have no authentic account. But there are traditions
with a highly probable basis of truth sufficient for the purposes of
the present Ossianic discussion. Two or three of the central facts
of the Finian period, as related in a preceding section, are as
follows:—</p>

<p>Finn MacCumhaill lived in the reign of Cormac MacArt who
ruled from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 227 to 266, and whose daughter Gràinne he married.
Goll MacMorni was a contemporary. Finn was slain in 283, but
the bards bring him somehow alive next year to pronounce a eulogy
on his grandson, Oscar, who fell in the battle of Gabhra. Ossian
and Caoilte lived for a hundred and fifty years longer; and the
blind old heathen bard relates the heroic achievements of his departed
fellow-heroes to St. Patrick who arrives in Ireland about
432. Chronology did not trouble the old ballad-makers of Albin
and Erin. Such an anachronism as brings Ossian of the third,
into conjunction with Patrick of the fifth century, did not disturb
their heroic muse.</p>

<p>Ireland claimed this Ossian as her own, and her learned doctors
declared that Macpherson stole his poems from their country.
Two or three words will be sufficient to dispose of all this: 1.
Macpherson never was in Ireland; and never kept up any correspondence
with Irishmen. 2. The Ossianic poems published by
the Dublin Gaelic Society and the Ossianic Society were all
collected and made known subsequent to the publication of Macpherson’s
Ossian. 3. <a id="tn-89">It is admitted</a> by the late Eugene O’Curry,
one of the highest authorities, that prior to the 15th century there
existed in Ireland only <em>eleven</em> Ossianic poems, which are extremely
short, and which will be found in the Book of Leinster, compiled
in the 13th, and in the Book of Lecan in the 15th century. Of
these, seven are ascribed to Finn himself, two to Ossian, one to
Fergus, and one to Caoilte. This clearly disposes of Ireland’s
claim to possess anything like Macpherson’s work. Indeed it has
been given up by some who advanced it, while at the same time
these writers and others laboured to manufacture and publish
poems <i lang="fr">a la</i> Macpherson; but to the great chagrin of these learned
sons of Erin the public will not assign them the same distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and appreciation, which have been accorded to Macpherson’s
productions.</p>

<p>Let us now glance at the genuine, and indisputably ancient
Ossianic ballads preserved in Scotland: 1. We have the tragic
tale of <i lang="gd">Deirdri</i> in the Glenmasan MS., bearing the date of 1238,
now in the Advocate’s Library. 2. There is a MS. of the 15th
century, containing a glossary and a poem of five quatrains, attributed
to Ossian. A text the same as this poem is in the Book of
Leinster of the 13th century. 3. There is the Book of the Dean of
Lismore, compiled between 1512-20 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> This book contains
28 Ossianic poems, nine of which are directly attributed to Ossian,
two to Fergus, one to Caoilte; two to Allan MacRuairi, and one
to GillieCallum Mac an Olla,—these two last bards being hitherto
unknown; and there are eleven anonymous ones, which in style
and subject belong to the Féinne. These twenty-eight poems extend
to 2500 lines, or one-fourth of all Macpherson’s Gaelic poems.
The rest of the extant heroic poetry has been collected in the
Highlands and Islands, chiefly within the last 150 years; and in
the main consists of versions of the same productions that we have
in the Book of the Dean of Lismore. They are genuine Highland
compositions of an ancient character, and some of them are instructive
as showing how far oral transmission during the last 400
years has affected their style and language.</p>

<p>We thus find that the work begun by Sir James Macgregor
upwards of 400 years ago, has been taken up at intervals by others
since his time. Towards the end of the last, and the beginning of
the present century the principal collectors of these ballads appeared.
Old men in all parts of the Highlands and Isles, famous
for their mnemonic and reciting powers were sought out by educated
natives and strangers, and their versions of the old ballads
taken down. The last and the greatest of the ballad and tale-collectors
was Mr Campbell, who in 1859-60 traversed the whole
Gaelic area; and assisted by intelligent Highlanders formed large
collections, of which he has given a considerable quantity to the
world, in his four volumes of tales. All these are genuine productions
of the Gaelic popular mind. No stigma or suspicion attaches
to them. Some of them are at least as ancient as the time of
Dean Macgregor—400 years ago; and they were regarded as
ancient then. In character and spirit they resemble—are in many
cases only Scottish versions of—the kindred literature of the Gael
of Ireland; and possess much definite value to the student of
social life and the philologist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>Although many of those heroic compositions have been probably
lost and others marred in their oral transmission, yet enough
remains to interest the literary student and the historic antiquary.
Upwards of 54,000 lines have been preserved, and are accessible
in that truly excellent and scientifically arranged work <i lang="gd">Leabhar na
Féinne</i>. In this body of literature we have indubitable proof of
the existence of a large mass of popular literature among the
ancient Gaels, who it is evident must have developed considerable
taste for ballad, song, and story.</p>

<p>It is hard to assign any date to the composition of these ballads.
They may have been composed centuries before they were committed
to writing. We have fragments such as the Glen-mason
MS. which were written as early as the 12th century, scarcely
anything earlier. These are written in the hand and language
common to the learned in both Albin and Erin at the time. The
book of the Dean of Lismore, however, is written phonetically to
represent the spoken language of his day, and is mainly in the
Perthshire dialect. The various collections of ballads made between
400 and 70 years ago exhibit different styles of writing, and
the unsettled modes of orthography prevalent at the time.</p>

<p>The poetic form of these productions is generally that of the
quatrain. Some pieces do not exceed a few stanzas in length,
others extend to 80 or 100 quatrains or to between 300 or 400
lines. Many archaic expressions are to be met with; but on the
whole when presented in modern orthography they are understood
by an ordinary Highlander. Not a few of these phrases, though
not generally understood, have been preserved and transmitted
even in the oral versions taken down within the last 100 years.</p>

<p>Some of the most ancient ballads relate to Cuchulin and his
deeds of deathly valour; others tell the tragic tale of Deirdri;
others relate to the Norse wars; and not the least romantic describe
the fierce combats and heroic conflicts in which the brave
heroes of the Féinne indulged on the shores and plains of Albin
and Erin. On many a field of fame, east and west, had the
banners of the Finian heroes gleamed and gained renown; but
with all their victories they always fell as they went forth to the
battle, until they all faded and disappeared “like sungleam in
wintry weather.”</p>


<h3>THE COCHULIN BALLADS.</h3>

<p>Taken in chronological order, the Cochulin ballads come up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
first for consideration. Much credit is due to Mr Campbell for
his attempt at a chronological classification of these productions, a
very difficult matter, considering the vagueness, historically, of
everything connected with the heroic period. As far as dates of
composition are concerned, all that can be safely affirmed is that
these ballads were composed between the Christian era and the
thirteenth century, some of them undoubtedly belonging to the
earlier, and some of them to the later centuries of that period.
Copies of many of them were made by Sir James Macgregor, Dean
of Lismore, between 1512-26. Then they were regarded as very
ancient. Those relating to Cochulin and to his son Conlach are:—<em>Cochulin
and Evir</em>; <em>Cochulin’s Sword</em>; <em>Cochulin’s Car</em>; <i lang="gd">Garbh
Mac Stairn</i>; <em>Conlach’s Death</em>; <em>The Heads</em>. According to ancient
annals Cochulin lived in the first century. <i lang="gd">Connal Cearnach Mac
Edirskeol</i> is the author of the last-mentioned ballad, <em>The Heads</em>,
and the most ancient of all the Heroic poets. Cochulin was his
foster-son; and when he was slain Connal revenged himself on his
enemies by putting them all to death. In the ballad, Evir, the
wife or betrothed of Cochulin, is told the names of those put to
death, whose heads he carried on a withe. There is a heroine of
Dun sgathaich, Skye, called Aoife, who also is mixed up with
Cochulin’s story. The length of the ballad is 96 lines. The
following is a literal translation of the first six <span class="nowrap">stanzas:—</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>THE DEIRDRI BALLADS.</h3>

<p>The next class is that of the <em>Deirdri Ballads</em>. The story of
<i lang="gd">Deirdri</i> and <i lang="gd">Clan Uisneach</i>, or the three brothers, <a id="tn-93">Naos, Ainle</a>,
and Ardan, sons of Uisneach, is very affecting and tragic. Mr
Campbell says:—“The story of Deirdre is related to Indian Epics,
and is an Aryan romance which pervades the whole world. A
beautiful girl, shut up to baulk a prophecy, is beloved by an old
King. She runs away with a family of brothers, and after adventures
of many kinds, the story ends in a tragedy.” Connachar,
King of Ireland, whose reign is placed about the middle of the
first century, was preparing to marry the beautiful princess, Deirdri,
when she ran away with the three sons of his sister, Naos, Ainle,
and Ardan. They went to Scotland, where they were well received.
The names of places in the ballads indicate that it was in Argyllshire
they settled. While the brothers were away on some expedition,
to Lochlin, it is supposed, Deirdri was left in charge of a
“black-haired lad,” it is said, in an islet north of Jura till they
would return. The “lad” began to make love to Deirdri in their
absence, but they came back opportunely to save her. By this
time Connacher sent them a message of peace from Ireland; and
believing that the once wrathful monarch was sincere they returned
to Ireland. But they were at once met with the hostile forces of
the King; and after a fierce struggle the King slew his nephews.
When Deirdri saw her beloved Naos and his brothers fall, she
rushed forward, bewailing them, and died upon their bodies.
There are six or seven versions of this story, the oldest being in
the MS. dated 1208, in the Advocates’ Library. It was written
at Glenmasan, in Cowal. The versions vary in length. The
longest contains upwards of 400 lines. The ballad is sometimes
divided into several parts, and some collectors give only one or
two parts. It is the part in which Deirdri laments her departure
from Scotland that is here translated. This and the Book of
Deer are the earliest specimens that we possess of written Gaelic
in Scotland.</p>

<p>The glens and other places mentioned in the following farewell
of Deirdri are readily identified. The large number of proper
names occurring in the piece renders it difficult to give anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
more than a very stiff translation, which is almost absolutely
<span class="nowrap">literal:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">On this tale, and on its connection with Scottish topography, Dr
MacLauchlan says:—“This is one of the most touching in the
catalogue of Celtic tales, and it is interesting to observe the influence
it exerted over the Celtic mind by its effect upon the topographical
nomenclature of the country. There are several Dun
Deirdres to be found still. One is prominent on the vale of the
Nevis, near Fort-William, and another occupies the summit of a
magnificent rock overhanging Loch Ness, in Stratherrick.” <em>Ness</em>,
the name of the loch, is thought to be from Naos. Dr Skene remarks—“Adomnan,
in his life of St. Columba, written in the
seventh century, appears to mention only three localities in connection
with St. Columba’s journey to the palace of the King of
the Picts, near Lochness, and these are Cainle (Ainle), Arcardan
(Ardan), and the flumen Nesae (Naise). Two vitrified forts in
the neighbourhood of Lochness are called Dun-<i lang="gd">Dearduil</i>.” The
same authority also observes that “the ancient legends of Cochulin
and the sons of Uisneach connect them with those remarkable
structures termed vitrified forts.” <span lang="gd">Dun-Sgathaig</span> and <span lang="gd">Dun-mhic-Uisneachan</span>
are vitrified like <span lang="gd">Dun-dhearduil</span>. It is suggested that
a mythic meaning underlies this topography and story.</p>


<h3>THE FINIAN BALLADS.</h3>

<p>A class of ballads which is wholly taken up with the Finian
heroes proper—with their intercourse and doings among themselves—may
be described as <em>Finnic</em> ballads. Finn is the central
hero; and the other Finian characters are his attendant satellites.</p>

<p>There was more than one class of heroes known as Féinn, or
Fianna:—</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>1. Féinn of Albin: Albin was north of the firths of the Forth
and Clyde.</p>

<p>2. Féinn of Erin: The same class of heroes in Ireland.</p>

<p>3. Féinn of Breatan: Breatan was the southern districts of
Scotland, Dunbreatan, or Dumbarton, being the principal
seat.</p>

<p>4. Féinn of Lochlin: These according to Tacitus, dwelt on the
right shore of the Suevic Sea, or the Baltic, and were called
the Aestii.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are some evidences which indicate that the last also were a
Celtic people, who spoke a Celtic language. The inhabitants of
this district now form part of the Kingdom of Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>It is the Féinn of Albin and of Erin that the heroic lays generally
celebrate. Trenmor, the fifth from Baoisgne, from whom
Finn and his followers were called Clanna Baoisgne, was general
of the Féinn; Cumhal, his son, was the father of Finn. Oisein,
Fergus, Raoidhne, or Rayne, and Cairol were the sons of Finn.
Oscar, the son of Oisein, was his grandson; and Diarmad was his
nephew, who eloped with his queen, Gràine, daughter of Cormac
Mac Art, King of Ireland, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 227. Caoilte, or Cailt, was a relative;
and Goll, or Gaul, Conan, and Garaidh were chiefs of the
Clann Morna. But the heroes, one after another, soon disappeared.
The theme of several of the principal ballads is the deaths of
Oscar, Diarmad, Gaul, &amp;c., and lastly, of Ossian himself, who was
left alone of all that noble band of heathen heroes. In his last
days the blind old bard came in contact with some Christian
Patrick, and dialogues of their discussions were for ages repeated
in Highland ballads. The following ballad, entitled the “Sweetest
Sound,” is a specimen of the less martial <span class="nowrap">kind:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“The rattling dice I love the most,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So Oscar spoke.—Thus Diarmad said,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">“I hear my sweetest sound.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Fingal said, “My music is</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The banner’s fluttering fold,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! alas! my sweetest sound</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To hear bards sing and heroes speak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And now they’ve perished all!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The above has been translated by Pattison, and I use his rendering.
It gives us a good picture of a social gathering of the
Finian heroes. The bowl goes round, the harpers begin, and the
warriors deliver themselves successively on the objects which most
moved their hearts. Fingal sat there as lord of the feast, and
directed their intercourse. Conan, rash and thoughtless, but bold,
loves the rattling dice; Oscar loves the waking of battle, Diarmad
the whispering of woman’s love, MacLuy the hound in the chase.
Fingal himself delights in the banner fluttering over the brave in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
battle, and Ossian, as usual, regretfully declares that his sweet
sound was once in the hall of Fingal, who now with his heroic
followers have all perished.</p>

<p>The titles of some of the other ballads are <cite>Ossian’s Lament</cite>,
<cite>Cailte and the Giant</cite>, &amp;c. We have a special set in several dialogues
between Ossian and Patrick on the Féinn and their exploits,
and on the comparative merits of the Christian religion and the
stories of the Féinne. One of them is called <cite lang="gd">Oisein agus an
Cleireach</cite>, or Ossian and the Cleric, in which we have a description
of a battle between the Finians and the Norse. The saint is
very agreeable in this poem, very unlike what he is in <cite>Ossian’s
Prayer</cite>, and concedes much to the bard, so much, indeed, that he
is willing to rear an altar, not to God, but to Finn! It is difficult
to say whether the ballad refers to a Manus, or Magnus, of the
third or of the twelfth century. Actually known historic facts
favour the latter. The length of the ballad varies; some of the
versions are upwards of two, some three hundred lines long.</p>

<p>Since the days of Eve and Helen women have been the cause
of much evil and strife; and many of the sore troubles of the
Féinn arose from the bewitching charms which their Gaelic maidens
and mothers possessed. The chief King of the Lochlins came to
the shore of Albin with “ten thousand barks”—the Northmen’s
galleys must have been very numerous in those times, our British
navy of the present day would be small in comparison—determined
to possess himself of the dog and wife of Finn, the Caledonian
monarch. In these days this might seem a small <i lang="la">casus belli</i> indeed;
but it must be remembered that the dog Bran was a most
remarkable one; the posthumous poetic honours that have been
paid to this canine worthy have far exceeded those that Byron has
given his favourite. As to the Caledonian Queen, the elopement
of Graine with Diarmad must not be forgotten; indeed, it may
help to explain the formidable descent of Magnus on the shores of
Albin. To put chivalrous heroes under <i lang="gd">geasan</i> was then a favourite
pastime among Gaelic ladies. And, being the weaker sex, it
was well that they should be invested with enchanting or supernatural
power that would somehow afford them protection in the
midst of the turbulent, ruthless forces by which they were surrounded
in those days. The battle and its results are described
in thirty verses more. The Norse invaders were worsted; Finn and
Magnus met in single combat; “stones and the heavy earth were
wakening under the soles of their feet.” At last the unfortunate
Magnus was overcome. Though unbecoming a king, he was
bound hands and feet; but ultimately he receives kind and
chivalrous treatment from Finn; and he repents of his conduct
towards him, to whose mercy he said he would trust when he
heard the bald Conan—who was “ever drinking”—express a wish
to be allowed to sever his head from his body. The author—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
ballad is put into the mouth of Ossian of course—concludes with
the declaration that he and his father and Gaul performed the
greatest feats that day, though they are now “without strength,”
compelled to listen to psalm-singing clerics.</p>

<p>A particularly interesting poem—one of the many dialogues
between Ossian and Patrick—is called <cite>Ossian’s Prayer</cite>. I translate
a few verses of the beginning of Macnicol’s version, which
will give an idea of the piece. It is about 150 lines in length.
The author makes Ossian a thorough heathen, who prefers the
glories of Finian deeds and fame to all the Christian prospects
that Patrick can unfold.</p>

<p>Poor Ossian will not receive the new doctrine of the saint; and
his arguments with Patrick are not of a very edifying character.
The saint, in order to convey to the bard some conception of the
Creator’s omniscience, says that it would not be possible for the
smallest midge to enter heaven without His knowledge. But the
bard exclaims in reply, that that was very different from Finn, son
of Cuhal, in his hospitable hall. Thousands might enter, partake
of his cheer, and depart without notice. At last Patrick gets
somewhat impatient with his rather unsatisfactory pupil, and requests
Ossian to give up his elegiac strains over the departed glory
of the Clan Baoisgne, and relate the particulars of some hunt,
battle, or adventure. The old warrior-bard is nothing loth, and is
consoled for the moment by the recital of the deeds of his perished
kinsmen, the Fianna. As usual he ends with a wild burst of
sorrow for having survived them all.</p>

<p>“<cite>Ossian and Evir-Alin</cite>” has been a great favourite. In this
ballad we have the great poet’s wooing of the beautiful Evir described.
He sets out with twelve youths to ask the daughter of
Branno “of the silver beakers.” Hitherto the maiden refused the
sons of kings and nobles, and even the great gloomy chieftain
Cormac, whom she particularly disliked. After necessary preliminary
questions the ballad (in Pattison’s translation) <span class="nowrap">proceeds:—</span></p>

<p>Then the heroes met face to face, and the strife was fierce and

the following result:</p>

<p>Oscar, the peerless son of Ossian, and the favourite grandson of
Finn, is one of the bravest and finest characters among the
Fingalians, and his early death greatly affected the hilarity of that
happy band of heroes and hunters. The following verses from
Gillies’s collection record, instructions and precepts which were
inculcated by his royal grandfather; (my own <span class="nowrap">translation):—</span></p>

<p>These are indeed noble sentiments and precepts from a semi-barbarian
monarch such as Finn is supposed to have been. It
may fairly be questioned whether this is not one of the more recent
productions. One line, “<span lang="gd">’na aobhar shininn mo lamh</span>”—<i>in
his cause</i>, &amp;c., reminds us of Christian conceptions. Such a
word as <i lang="gd">aobhar</i>, cause, does not, so far as I am aware, occur in the
purely heathen poems.</p>

<p>The ballads on the deaths of Diarmad and of Oscar are among
the best, and have been <a id="tn-104">great favourites</a> with popular reciters.
The <cite>Lay of Diarmad</cite> seems to have given names to many places
in Scotland and Ireland. The names of the heroes of the Féinn
in general we find embedded in the nomenclature of the soil,
especially the name of Finn, their great leader. This is evidence
of the early era in which they lived, as well as of the affection with
which the people cherished their memories. The death of Oscar
is a very long ballad. What follows is a free rendering of upwards
of the first <span class="nowrap">half:—</span></p>

</div>

<p>I take the following lines of the close of this grand ballad from
Pattison’s blank-verse translation. Finn was beside his grandson
before he breathed his last. Oscar heard the great king’s wailing
cry, and looking round on all he sighed and said, “Farewell! I
shall return no more.” Finn, who never wept before in sight of
man but once, when Bran died, strode a pace away and wept.
<span class="nowrap">But—</span></p>

<p>These are some of the scenes of the great battle of <i lang="gd">Gabhra</i>, the
Temora of Macpherson, fought about the year 284 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></span></p>

<p>Strong-minded ladies in these days clamour for women’s rights;
but if men are wise they will, before conceding these, consider
what use was made by women in the early days of Finian chivalry
of the rights which they then enjoyed. In these Islands in ancient
days the gentler sex appears to have possessed some extraordinary
powers and to have exercised terrible privileges which were sometimes
abused. If a lady put <i lang="gd">Geasan</i> (obligation) on a knight or
chief there was no escape from the execution of her wishes. He
had to obey her, however unreasonable the request might be.
Thus when the great Finn himself was in the earlier stages of his
barbarian youth, before he became the celebrated General of the
Féinn, and when he had no better raiment than the skins of the
animals he slew for food, he came across one fine morning a grand
assemblage of ladies resting on one bank of a great chasm, and a
party of gentlemen on the other. One of the former, a proud
Princess, insisted in her lover’s case that he should clear that chasm
before she gave him her hand; but the poor fellow kept clapping
his arms round his body till he could screw his courage to the
springing point. Finn understood the conditions, and observed
the unfortunate fellow’s predicament, and modestly asked if she
would take himself for her wedded lord on his accomplishing the
task. She replied that he looked a personable enough man,
though marvellously ill clad, and that if he succeeded she would
give him the privilege. Finn did succeed, but she laid <i lang="gd">Geasa</i> on
him that he should accomplish the same task every year. This
was not the only one that laid <i lang="gd">Geasa</i> on Finn. Another fair
tyrant insisted on his leaping over a dallan as high as his chin,
with a similar pillar-stone of the same dimensions borne upward on
the palm of his hand. In after days <a id="tn-109">he acknowledged in</a> confidence
to his father-in-law, that this was the most difficult feat he had ever
performed, and few indeed would be disposed to doubt his assertion.
On one occasion Finn nearly failed in one of these exploits;
the cause of his failure was thought to be his meeting a red-haired
woman on the road, and that it was a Friday morning. It is
evident that these Gaelic princesses were a little too exacting, and
that it would not do for every one to undertake satisfying their
somewhat unreasonable demands. That the laying on of <i lang="gd">Geasa</i>
was attended at times with much discomfort and danger is illustrated
in the history of the beautiful but unfortunate Diarmad
MacDoon.</p>

<p>Diarmad appears to have possessed one fatal gift—the <i lang="gd">ball-seirce</i>—that
of kindling love in all the women he met. It is said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
there was a spot of beauty on his forehead which captivated all
the ladies that saw him. He was the nephew of the king; and
full proud was Finn at times of the deeds of valour which his
sister’s son had achieved. He was generally described as the
young, the beautiful, the brown-haired Diarmad. He was as
brave and gallant as he was handsome, and a universal favourite
among the Féinn. But he was soon to come under the influence
of the inexorable <i lang="gd">Geasa</i> which decided “the woful fate of MacDoon.”
At the wedding feast of Finn and Gràine, the daughter
of King Cormac, the bride lays <i lang="gd">Geasa</i> on Diarmad to carry her off;
and though this was highly repugnant to his loyal feeling, and in
direct contravention to his military oath, as well as against his
personal interests, he was obliged to comply. With what result
the well known ballad, called “The Lay of Diarmad,” describes.
There are many versions of this ballad; the one translated here
is that found in “The Book of the Dean of Lismore.” It is here
entitled “<span lang="gd">Bàs Dhiarmaid;</span>” or, “<em>The Death of Diarmad</em>. “<span lang="gd">A
houdir so Allane M’Royree,</span>” or “<em>The Author of this is Allan
M’Rorie</em>,” is prefixed. MacRorie was probably a mere reciter.
The ballad begins <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, the ill that did there betide!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas the clank of the Finian arms,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Which the spear and the shaft of the quiver</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the hunter so often defied.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In another version Finn is here represented as saying to Diarmad—“Son
of Doon, dost thou wish to win honour?”—thus the king
spoke wrathfully; and added—“Slay that boar by thyself, thou
gay victor, which the heroes so long has defied.” Diarmad
attempts the task.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then MacDoon of the keen-edged arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Comes up with the monster fierce,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With his strong poisoned spear he tried</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But his spear broke—shivered in three—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">On that tough and bristling hide;</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">That spear he vainly plied.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then from its sheath he drew</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His blade of renown—thin-leaved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with it MacDoon slew the monster</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While no hurt he himself received.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Finn is greatly disappointed at Diarmad’s success. He evidently
calculated that in his struggle with the boar alone his nephew
would receive his death-hurt. This was not the case, <span class="nowrap">and—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Finn of the Féinn grew sad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And sat on the side of the hill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It grieved him that brave MacDoon</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Escaped without wound or ill.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the first Finn cannot be said to have adopted a very
magnanimous plan for punishing his nephew; but jealousy being
cruel as the grave, he has formed now a cruel expedient for compassing
his <span class="nowrap">death:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">After long silence he spoke—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These evil words spoke he—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Diarmad, measure the boar from the snout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tell how many feet long he be.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Finn he had never refused—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Alas! him no more we meet—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He measures the back of the boar—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">MacDoon of the lightsome feet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the other versions it is told that Diarmad’s feet were bare, and
that the length of the boar was sixteen feet. Finn denied that he
was so long, and insisted on a second measuring.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Diarmad, measure with care again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The boar <em>against the hair</em>;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mournful it was to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That deed of the hero fair.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He went on that errand sad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And measured the boar again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he trod on a poisonous bristle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he felt in his heel a pain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The hero fell on the field—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">MacDoon that had no deceit;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He lay there beside the boar:—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now, there is the tale complete.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this part of the relation another version adds that Diarmad,
in asking several times for a drink at the hand of Finn, rehearsed
how he served him “eastward and westward.” But the king replied
that the ill he had done him in one hour outweighed all the
good exploits he could tell. “Thou shalt yet get no drink from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
my shell.” Diarmad then addresses a melancholy farewell to Ben-Gulbin,
the hill of his love, and to courtship. He keenly feels his
sorrowful plight as his life-blood is ebbing away; and true to his
character his last thoughts are, as he dies, of “the maids of the
Féinn.” Finn then relents, and pronounces a regretful eulogy over
the dead body of Diarmad. In the Dean’s version it is the bard
himself that pronounces the praise of the dead, in verses which
describe his person and <span class="nowrap">character:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pierced to the heart he lies,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">On this hillock I see his grave.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The blue-eyed hawk of Essroy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The victor in every fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pierced by the poisonous bristle—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There he lies on the height!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">By the jealous design of Finn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fell the bright-souled MacDoon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Redder his lips than the cherry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whiter his breast than the sun.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His tresses flowed golden yellow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Long eyelash ’neath brow so fair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blue and gray in his eye;</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Gentle and sweet in his speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was that champion clothed with might;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With elegant hands and a faultless form,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair winner of women’s love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">MacDoon of the witching eyes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In courtship he’ll ne’er engage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For there ’neath the sod he lies.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor with steed nor with hunter shall Diarmad</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Go forth for the chase again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The loved son of beauty and valour</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is left there, alas, in the Glen!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <cite>Death of Diarmad</cite>, like the <cite>Death of Oscar</cite>, has been a great
favourite with reciters. But believers in the authenticity of Macpherson’s
“Ossian” regard the former as inferior poetry. The
author of the version translated above, Allan Macrorie, lived probably
in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. Glen-Shee, mentioned
in the poem, is a well-known locality in Perthshire, and Ben-Gulbin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
is a hill in Glen-Shee. But this is not the only place that is said
to be the scene of the slaying of the boar and of Diarmad’s death.
The district around West Loch Tarbert, Kintyre, also affords
topographical indications of the famous hunt having taken place
there. Nor can the claims of our friends, the Irish, be forgotten;
they also have their <i lang="gd">Sliabh Gulbin</i>.</p>

<p>When some of the ballads are described as <em>Ossianic</em> it is not to
be understood that they were composed at the time that Ossian is
supposed to have lived, but that the theme is Ossianic. Of this
class is a eulogistic poem on Finn in the Book of the Dean of
Lismore. Although written nearly 400 years ago it has yet a
modern ring about it as compared with many of the other ballads.
The earlier versions of these Ossianic ballads were composed probably
in Pagan times, but as the Pagan reciters of them were dying
off, the minstrels nominally Christian would take their place, and
adapt the old ballads to the new state of things. The elder productions
would be undergoing continual transformations in the
hands of every new class of reciters. While the theme is the same,
sometimes the versions are so different that no single verse in the
one can be found in the other. It is in this manner that their
chronology becomes a puzzle. Anachronisms abound. Ossian,
who flourished upwards of two hundred years before, is introduced
by the Christian and post-Ossianic reciters as holding converse
with St. Patrick.</p>

<p>“<span lang="gd">Actor hujus Ossane M’Finn;</span>” or <em>The Author of this is Ossian,
the Son of Finn</em>, is prefixed to the poem of which I am now to give
a translation. In the course of the ages, Ossian has had to accept
the paternity of many productions; but people took this as a
matter of course until the appearance of the celebrated works of
James Macpherson 250 years after Sir James Macgregor prefixed
Ossian’s name to this poem. The poetry of this piece is not of a
very high order, but is interesting as giving the popular conceptions
regarding Finn 400 years ago. It was probably composed by an
ecclesiastic, the number of which class at the time in the Highlands
was considerable. It begins <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For twice three days and one great Finn I did not see;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ne’er before a week such sorrow brought to me.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">My teacher and my strength, my guidance and my light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both poet he and chief, a king my love commands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Finn, monarch of the Féinn, the lord of many lands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leviathan at sea, a lion on the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keen as the air-borne hawk, and wise in art and lore;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s courteous and just, a ruler firm and true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full polished in his ways, deceit he never knew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lofty chief is he in song and in the fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resistless to the foe, to friends their fame and might.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His skin is like the chalk, his cheek is like the rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His eye transparent blue, his hair like gold down flows.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trust of all his men, with every charm of mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prepared for worthy deed, to women meek and kind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great champion was he, loved son of field and flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The brightness of the blades, the tree above each wood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full generous was the king—good and rich wine he poured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the large green-hued bottle on the festive board.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We never read in the older ballads of such non-primitive things as
bottles. <i lang="gd">Am botul mor glas</i>, which the liberal Finn would place
on the table, must have belonged to the fifteenth century. The
good qualities of Finn are not yet exhausted.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is rather curious to find the stereotyped “Erin of the Saints,”
in a composition <a id="tn-115">of the fifteenth</a> century. While suggesting the
ecclesiastical character of the author, it does not prove that he
was a very zealous “saint” himself; for we find that he quietly
ascribes to Finn exploits which the Irish ecclesiastical world has
all along attributed to St. Patrick. “He cleared the lakes of
monsters and the land of serpents.” As usual, Ossian himself is
described as <i lang="gd">an deigh na</i> <span class="nowrap"><i lang="gd">Féinne</i>:—</span></p>

of the Finians, which were said to have been hidden under Loch
<i>Lene</i> (Killarney), that reminds us of the robes of wool in Finn’s
house. The Irishman and the Highlander got the conception
probably from the same <span class="nowrap">source:—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And hundreds of swords, “broad” and “glittering,” and shields,
and gold and raiment in plenty. The Scottish author, perhaps
because his ideas were cast in a more ancient mould, was somewhat
more modest in his description of Finian wealth.</p>


<h3>THE NORSE BALLADS.</h3>

<p>The Norse ballads constitute another class. The wars between
the Féinn and the Lochlins are the theme of many of the ancient
Ossianic ballads. It is impossible to say exactly to what age they
severally belong. The Vikings, or sea-rovers, began their visits to
the Western Isles and Ireland as early as the first century, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
continued these visits for more than a thousand years. The name
Viking has no connection with King being derived from vic, a bay—vicing,
baysman—as Mr Robertson has clearly shown. The
erroneous translation <em>sea-kings</em> has been used by several writers.
It is the same word as the Gaelic <i lang="gd">Uig</i>, the name of places on the
west sides of Skye and Lewis. In English it assumes the form of
<em>Wick</em>—Inner<em>wick</em>. It also means a bay or creek in Gaelic, as
found in the words of a poet, “<i lang="gd">uigean saile</i>.” In 794 the
Western Isles were ravaged and Iona destroyed. The monastery
of Iona was burnt in 802 by these Vikings; and in 806 the family
of Iona, sixty-eight in number, were slain. The abbot of Iona
then retired to Kells, Ireland, and Iona ceased to be the centre
of Gaelic learning, while all relics of Gaelic culture were removed
to Dunkeld and other places.</p>

<p>The Gaelic people of Albin and Erin call the Danes and the
Vikings Lochlins. The Vikings were originally half Celtic,
if not altogether a Celtic race. Indeed the substrata of many of
the Germanic tribes were originally Celtic.</p>

<p>The following ballad probably relates to the wars of the eleventh
<span class="nowrap">century:—</span></p>

<p>The above set of verses occur in several ballads with considerable
variations. It was a sort of national war-song among the
Finian leaders in their frequent conflicts with the Norwegians. In
the translation several verses are taken from different sources.</p>

<p>Heroic daring and deeds are ascribed by the bard to each of the
warrior-chieftains. Brown Diarmad MacDoon is foremost in the
fight; the valiant Rayne leaves cloven heads behind him; great
Gaul is ever the first to fight, and never turns his back on the foe;
Cailte has won his fame on many a field; Oscar bears the proudest
name of all the chiefs; and, finally, Finn himself comes before us,
his banner, Deo-greine (Sunbeam), gleaming with its spangles of
fame over that heroic band, whom he now invites to sweep down
on the Lochlins.</p>

<p>The specimens now given of the ancient ballad poetry of the
Gael will be sufficient to indicate its character and style. It only
remains now to mention in connection with the heroic ballads the
names of a few more of the better known ones.</p>

<p>There is a very fine ballad on the death of <em>Dearg</em> or Dargo.
Others are the Expeditions or <i lang="gd">Imeachd</i> of Finn, of <i lang="gd">Naoinear</i>, or
Nine, &amp;c., and the Great Distress of the Fingalians—<i lang="gd">Teantachd
Mor na Féinne</i>. A Norwegian <em>Hag</em> is the theme of a good deal
of composition, while the <em>Invasion of Magnus</em> or <em>Manus</em> is a
ballad of considerable length and interest. This was probably
the celebrated Magnus Barefoot, so well-known in the Hebrides,
and throughout the north-west. From the Orkneys to the Isle
of Man and Ireland, along the west coast of Scotland, the Lochlins
traversed the seas for centuries and held rule; and well did they
and the Highlanders know one another.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp">PROSE ROMANCES.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lying, worldly stories concerning the Tuatha de Danann, the sons of
Milesius, and Finn Mac Cumhail with his Feine.”—<span class="smcap">Carsuel</span> (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1567.)</p>
</div>


<p>It may be thought by some that too much has been said concerning
the ballads and the character of the Féinne. Others may
be quite dissatisfied with the fragmentary notices which have been
taken of those grand Gaelic ancestors. The former ought to bear in
mind that the authors of these Celtic romances were the fathers
and for centuries the cultivators of Gaelic song and story; and
that they were also “the cause” of much rhyme and romance in
others. The student of Gaelic literature can no more give up his
devotion to Ossian and to the bards who were his contemporaries
and successors than the English student can forget his Chaucer and
Spenser and the glorious poetic host of the Elizabethan age. The
latter ought to remember that instead of a few paragraphs it would
require many volumes to bring forward with fair adequacy the
literature and history of the Finian period.</p>

<p>Let us now glance at the popular fictions of Irish romancists. To
the Scottish student these are suggestive as presenting similar but
varying conceptions regarding the same class of heroes.</p>

<p>As bearing on the Irish character of the present day, it is very
remarkable that the Irish versions of the stories and ballads are, as
compared with those of Scotland, characterised by more magnificent
exaggerations and more gorgeous romance. The glow of
richer eloquence and of a more splendid verbiage, combined at the
same time with more of the sense of the ludicrous and incongruous,
is felt as you tread the famous field of <i lang="gd">Magh-lene</i>, or the more renowned
scene of <i lang="gd">Cathgarbh</i> [Gabhra], or listen to the cleverly
invented dialogues between Ossian and Patrick, in the company
and under the guidance of the Irish Gaelic literati. This is worth
noting, for it indicates how early essential differences began to
develop between the two tribes of the same race. At this very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
day the natural eloquence of Irishmen (<a id="tn-121">proverbially all</a> born orators)
far transcends that of Highlanders, whose hardy native hills appear
to have made them generally more men of brave deeds than of
eloquent good words. The richer soil and the softer climate of
Ireland have had a more emasculating influence on the Irish brother
tribes; but nature is not always unkind; this possible disadvantage
is more than counterbalanced by the rich flow, suavity, and sweetness
of the Irish tongue. It is not only the eloquence but the
peculiar character of Irish wit and humour that is traceable in
Eire’s versions of the Celtic romances. There is also a stationary
element observable in the history of the nation. The pre-Celtic,
Celtic or Finian Ireland is very much to-day what it was upwards
of a thousand years ago. St. Patrick may have made the most
of Ireland nominally Christian but the essential heathenism of
many of the people has never been yet eradicated; nor was it in
the Highlands till this century, deeply and powerfully as the people
were touched by drastic ecclesiastical and political changes. A
Highland bard of great natural abilities and poetic endowments—William
Livingston—has very well expressed in an interesting
poem, “<span lang="gd">Eirin a’ gul</span>” (Erin weeping), his satisfied conviction that
the people have never changed. Livingston sang as a Scottish
Gael of the pre-Reformation days would. He had as little regard
for his Holiness in Rome as he had for the late Rev. Principal
Candlish, of Edinburgh, when the latter was preaching in Greenock,
and Livingston assumed a threatening attitude as if he would dirk
the preacher, who had the temerity to touch up the Highlanders—about
the Sustentation Fund, I suppose. It is melancholy to observe—especially
suggestive to those who make so much of our
boasted advancement in civilisation—that the Gaelic peasantry of
Munster to-day cannot show that they have risen higher on the
steps of their ancestral dead selves than what they were when the
Gaelic ballads were first rehearsed on the glens and bens of ancient
<i lang="gd">Muiman</i>. The same remark till recently was applicable to many
parts of the Highlands.</p>

<p>Among the most famous of the old Celtic romances are the
three tragical stories of the “Children of Tuirrean,” the “Children
of Lir,” and the “Children of Uisneach,” whom we have already
come across in the Gaelic ballads; also the “Pursuit of Diarmad,”
and the “Cattle Raid of Cuailgne.” As it has been always so
popular in both Scotland and Ireland, let us look at the “Pursuit
of Diarmad.” There is no space for even the briefest outlines of
the large number of other celebrated fictions. The following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
paragraphs from this nearly endless <em>Pursuit</em> may be compared
with the Scottish poetical version already given.</p>

<p>Finn is about to be married to the daughter of King Cormac,
and high festival is held in the banquetting hall of royal Tara.</p>

<p>The King of Erin sits down to enjoy drinking and pleasure, with
his wife at his shoulder, and Gràine at her shoulder. Finn MacCuhail
is at the King’s right hand. Cairbre Liffeachair, the son
of the king, is there, and so is Ossian, the son of Finn. The other
chief Finian heroes are also there. (In the quotations I follow the
Irish orthography of the proper names.)</p>

<p>“‘Tell me now,’ said Grainne to Daire Mac Morna of the
songs, ‘who is that warrior at the right shoulder of Oisin, the son
of Fionn?’ ‘Yonder,’ said the druid, ‘is Goll Mac Morna, the
active, the warlike.’ ‘Who is that warrior at the shoulder of Goll?’
said Grainne. ‘Oscar, the son of Oisin,’ said the druid. ‘Who
is that graceful-legged-man at the shoulder of Oscar?’ said Grainne.
‘Caoilte Mac Ronain,’ said the druid. ‘What haughty, impetuous
warrior is that, yonder, at the shoulder of Caoilte?’ said Grainne.
‘The son of Lughaidh of the mighty hand, and that man is sister’s
son to Fionn Mac Cumhaill,’ said the druid. ‘Who is that
freckled, sweet-worded man, upon whom is the curling dusky-black
hair, and [who has] the two red ruddy cheeks, upon the left hand
of Oisin, the son of Fionn?’ ‘That man is Diarmad, the grandson
of Duibhne, the white-toothed, of the lightsome countenance;
that is the best lover of women and of maidens that is in the whole
world.’ ‘Who is that at the shoulder of Diarmad?’ said Grainne.
‘Diorruing, the son of Dobhar Damhadh O’Baoisgne, and that
man is a druid and a skilful man of science,’ said Daireduanach.
‘That is a goodly company,’ said Grainne.”</p>

<p>Miss Gràine Mac Cormac, or rather Princess Gràine, might well
make this remarkable admission regarding the character of those
heroes. She was emphatically a woman. The above series of
questions is thoroughly in harmony with the inquisitorial character
of ladies of fashion in general, as well as with ordinary feminine
curiosity. This curiosity was awakened by the vision of and contact
with a band of conquering heroes whose names have mysteriously
touched the heart of the Celtic world for centuries. Let
handsome young Diarmads be careful. Gràinne “called her attendant
handmaid to her, and told her to bring to her the jewelled-golden-chased
goblet which was in the <i lang="gd">grianan</i> after her. The
handmaid brought the goblet, and Grainne filled the goblet forthwith,
and there used to go into it the drink of nine times nine men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Grainne said, ‘Take the goblet to Fionn first, and bid him take a
draught out of it, and disclose to him that it is I that sent it to
him.’” This was done by the obsequious handmaid; the same
dose was sent to Cormac, his wife, and son, by the orders of
Princess Gràine, with the result that “one after another they
fell into a stupor of sleep and of deep slumber.” The scheming
Gràine might well be satisfied with the immediate fruits of the
potations which she administered to her father, Fionn and the rest.
She is now to administer a dose of a different sort to Finn’s
nephew, Diarmad. And while we cannot refuse our sympathies
to the brave and betrothed Finn, severe as our ethics in the marital
sphere may be, yet we cannot also help remembering that it was
hard for a young princess to be wedded to even a sovereign person
whose son and grandson were present. She must have intuitively
felt it would be the union of June and December. Diarmad, “the
white-toothed, of the lightsome countenance;” and “the best
lover of women and of maidens in the whole world,” and Finn’s
nephew, would naturally be esteemed a more desirable admirer by
this highly passionate and royal girl.</p>

<p>Gràine turns to Diarmad and says to him: “Wilt thou receive
courtship from me, O son of Duibhne?” “I will not,” said Diarmad.
“Then,” said Gràine, “I put thee under bonds of danger
and destruction, O Diarmuid, that is, under the bonds of Dromdraoidheachta,
if thou take me not with thee out of this household
to-night, ere Fionn and the King of Erin arise out of that sleep.”
Diarmad replies by speaking of the bonds as “evil,” and indulges
in expressions or self-depreciation. She reminds him of some
brave deeds he performed once “on the plain of Teamhair [Tara],”
when “Fionn and the seven battalions of the standing Fenians
chanced to be there.” She insinuates that this was the cause of
her admiration, seeing Diarmad taking “his caman from the next
man to him, and winning the goal three times upon Cairber and
upon the warriors of Teamhair.” She turned the light of her eyes
upon him that day, and never gave her love to another, nor would
she till she died. Diarmad wonders why it was not Finn that was
the object of her love instead of himself, because “there is not in
Erin a man that is fonder of a woman than he.” He now makes
another excuse: Finn has the keys of Tara; they cannot leave the
town. But the willing lady finds means of exit for herself and the
reluctantly gallant gentleman. “There is a wicket-gate to my
<i lang="gd">Grianan</i>, and we will pass out through it.” Diarmad, after some
more ungallant excuses, goes to “his people,” and particularly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Ossian, and says, “O, Oisin, son of Fionn, what shall I do with
these bonds that have been laid on me?” “Thou are not guilty
of the bonds which have been laid on thee,” said Oisin, “and I
tell thee to follow Grainne, and keep thyself well against the wiles
of Fionn.” The soft-hearted, but irresolute Diarmad, questions
the rest of the Finian heroes in a similar fashion; and they all
appear to be favourable to Gràine’s proposition and bonds; one
of them, Caoilte, says very gallantly and emphatically, “I say that
I have a fitting wife, and yet I had rather than the wealth of the
world that it had been to me that Grainne gave that love.” This
sounds very like the possible determination of a chivalrous Irish
colonel of “the seven battalions of the standing Fenians.” After
a little further hesitation, Diarmad at last exclaims. “Then go
forward, O Grainne.” The hero now enters on a series of manly
exploits. Gràine and he flee into Clanrickard, in Galway, where
he fortifies a little grove in which they shelter themselves. Those
in pursuit discover this grove, but Diarmad’s sagacious advisers
before he left send the knowing dog, Bran, half-human, half-brute,
to warn him. Bran has “knowledge and wisdom,” and thrusts
his head into Diarmad’s bosom. That, and the friendly shouts of
the dog’s far-off masters are sufficient.</p>

<p>There now appears in the relation a character well known in
many stories—<i lang="gd">Aonghas</i>, or Angus, <em>vel</em> Innes, <em>vel</em> Æneas, of the
Brough, a place on the Boyne. He was the son of Dagdae, a king
of the Danaans in Ireland; and <i lang="la">mirabile dictu</i> reigned over the
island for eighty years. He was a great friend of Diarmad, to
whom he presented two remarkable swords and two javelins equally
remarkable and <em>venomous</em> in their character, designated—the former
<i lang="gd">Moraltagh</i> and <i lang="gd">Begaltagh</i>; and the latter, <i lang="gd">Gathdearg</i> and <i lang="gd">Gathbuidhe</i>.
He now comes to the help of the eloping fugitives in their
besieged “grove,” where “Grainne awoke out of her sleep” in a
rather disconcerted state of mind. <i lang="gd">Aonghas</i> carries her off in a
fold of his mantle, but Diarmad will not submit to be rescued in
that rather inglorious fashion.</p>

<p>After that Aonghas and Gràine had departed. Diarmad “arose
as a straight pillar and <a id="tn-124">stood upright</a>, and girded his arms and
his armour and his various sharp weapons about him.” He came
to a door of the seven-wattled doors that there were to the enclosure,
and asked who was at it. One or other of the chiefs of
the Féinne was at the first five doors at which he successively interrogated;
and each and all of them were ready to permit him
tacitly to make his escape, but his chivalrous nature would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
allow him to regain his freedom in any unknightly fashion. The
sixth wicket is hostile: but it is not Finn’s. He comes to the
seventh:—“He asked who was at it? ‘Here are Fionn, the son
of Cumhaill, the son of Art, the son of Treunmhor, O’Baoisgne,
and four hundred hirelings with him; and we bear thee no love,
and if thou wouldst come out to us, we would cleave thy bones
asunder.’ ‘I pledge my sword,’ said Diarmuid, ‘that the door at
which thou art, O Fionn, is the first [<em>i.e.</em>, the very] door by which
I will pass of [all] the doors.’ Having heard that Fionn charged
his battalions on pain of their death, and of their instant destruction,
not to let Diarmad pass them without their knowledge. Diarmuid
having heard that, arose with an airy, high, exceeding light bound,
by the shafts of his javelins and by the staves of his spears, and
went a great way out beyond Fionn and beyond his people without
their knowledge or perception. He looked back upon them, and
proclaimed to them that he had passed them, and slung his shield
upon the broad arched expanse of his back, and so went straight
westward; and he was not long in going out of sight of Fionn and
of the Fenians.”</p>

<p>At Ros-da-shoileach (now Limerick) the hero found Aonghas
and Gràine in a warm and comfortable hut, with half a wild boar
on spits. Aonghas departs, leaving with them his best counsel
against “the wiles of Finn.”</p>

<p>After availing themselves of various refuges, the fugitive pair
approach the west coast of Kerry, where they see the allies of
Fionn from the French coast drawing close to the shore. Nine
times nine warriors step ashore, and Diarmad inquires what was
their business, and what county they came from. <a id="tn-125">They reply that</a>
they are “the three royal chiefs of Muir-n-iocht,” and are now
come at Fionn Mac Cumhaill’s order to seek and to curb “a forest
marauder” called Diarmuid O’Duibhne, whom he has outlawed.
In a trial of skill Diarmuid kills fifty of these French Finians.
These are styled “green” Finians, with three of whom Diarmad
deals somewhat remorselessly in the course of a day or two. Their
names will be interesting to the Gaelic reader—<i lang="gd">Duch-chosach</i>
(black-footed), <i lang="gd">Fionn-chosach</i> (fair-footed), <i lang="gd">Treun-chosach</i> (strong-footed).
Before he finally encounters these and the “three
enchanted hounds” Diarmad thus accoutres himself:—“He girt
about him his suit of battle and of conflict, under which, through
which, or over which, it was not possible to wound him; and he
took the Moralltach, that is the sword of Aonghas na Brogha, at
his left side, which [sword] left no stroke nor blow unfinished at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
the first trial. He took likewise his two thick shafted javelins of
battle—from which none recovered, either man or woman, that
had ever been wounded by them. After that, Diarmuid roused
Grainne and bade her keep watch and ward for Muadhan, [saying]
that he himself would go to view the four quarters around him.
When Grainne beheld Diarmuid with bravery and daring [clothed]
in his suit of anger and of battle, fear and great dread seized her.”
But an off-hand reply “soothed Grainne, and then Diarmuid went
in that array to meet the green Finians.” These are part of the
troubles and feats of Diarmad MacDoon, the alleged ancestor of
the great MacCailein line. The romance will be found in the
third volume of the Transactions of the Dublin Ossianic Society,
well edited by Mr S. H. O’Grady. Our own Highland versions
on the subject are tolerably well known.</p>

<p>During the dreamy period of the Middle Ages the great literary
source of amusement among the Gaels of Scotland were the
“<span lang="gd">Ursgeuls</span>,” <em>noble</em> or romantic tales, which upwards of thirty
years ago were collected and published (1859-62) by J. F. Campbell,
Esq., of Islay. They were not produced in the heroic ages,
the period of the great mass of our ballad literature. The ballads
and the tales, no doubt, have been mixed together; but the latter
are distinctly of a later growth. Some of the tales were manufactured
as recently as the eighteenth century; but the most of them
belong to the pre-Reformation period. Some of them are traceable
to classical sources; others indicate relationship with Oriental
stories. From Japan to the Hebrides, as shown by Mr Campbell
in his introduction and notes to the four volumes of his “West
Highland Tales,” are found the relics of the same original “<span lang="gd">Sgeulachd</span>,”
with the modifications which country, clime, and circumstance
would naturally necessitate. In their fundamental lines or
conceptions these tales are the common property of the whole
Aryan race—of the Hindoo in the east, and of the German and
Celt of the west. The study of talelogy, as well as philology, leads
us to the common origin of all the members of the Indo-European
family. Many of the Highland tales must have been matured
under the spirit that the crusades into the east invoked in the west.
We find reference in them to Turks, Greeks, Romans, Spaniards,
Franks, &amp;c., and to conditions of life which show their close
relations to mediæval times. They became the popular literary
sustenance of the people, supplying the want which is met by the
popular works of fiction or novels of the present day. We find
every phase of character exhibited in their outlines, extravagant as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
many of them often are. They are still waiting classification.</p>

<p>Mr Campbell was a very enthusiastic collector of these tales
for years. He traversed more than once the whole of the Highlands
to gather up these fragments of bygone Celtic life. His
success far exceeded his sanguine anticipations. His volumes
constitute the monument of his success, as well as of the industry,
talent, and scientific spirit which he brought to bear upon the work.
He had many hearty assistants in all parts of the Highlands, whom
he inspired <a id="tn-127">with much of his</a> own enthusiasm. Mr Hector MacLean,
of Ballygrant, Islay, an able Gaelic scholar, and a man of
real culture and literary talent, helped him in transcribing the
Gaelic, while he himself transferred the tales into literal idiomatic
English. It has been fortunate for our limited Gaelic literature
that Mr Campbell has left us so much of our popular prose in
these goodly four volumes, and so much of genuine ballad poetry
in his “<span lang="gd">Leabhar na Féinne.</span>” I give a specimen of these tales in
translation. Space will not admit of giving the <i lang="gd">sgeulachd</i> complete;
but enough is presented to illustrate the general style and character.
The reader of these tales realises at once their kinship with the
Danish tales of Andersen, the German stories of Grimm, and the
Welsh Mabinogion translated by Lady Guest.</p>


<h3><span lang="gd">MAOL A’ CHLIOBAIN.</span></h3>

<p>There was a widow once of a time, and she had three daughters,
and they said to her that they were going to seek their fortunes.
She prepared three bannocks. She said to the big daughter,
“Whether do you like best the little half with my blessing, or the
big half with my curse?” “I like best,” said she, “the big half
with your curse.” She said to the middle one, “Whether do you
like best the big half with my curse, or the little half with my
blessing?” “I like best,” said she, “the big half with your curse.”
She said to the little one, “Whether do you like best the big half
with my curse, or the little half with my blessing?” “I like best
the little half with your blessing.” This pleased her mother, and
she gave her the other half likewise.</p>

<p>They left, but the two elder ones did not wish to have the
younger one with them, and they tied her to a stone. They held on,
and when they looked behind them whom did they see coming
but her with the rock on her back. They let her alone for a while
until they reached a stack of peats, and they tied her to the peat-stack.
They held on for a while, when whom did they see coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
but her with the stack of peats on her back. They let her alone
for a while until they reached a tree, and they tied her to the tree.
They held on, and whom did they see coming but her with the
tree on her back. They saw that there was no use meddling with
her. They loosed her and they let her come with them. They
were travelling till night overtook them. They saw a light far
from them, and if it was far from them they were not long reaching
it. They went in. What was this but the house of a giant. They
asked to remain overnight. They got that, and they were set to
bed with the three daughters of the giant.</p>

<p>There were turns of amber beads around the necks of the giant’s
daughters, and strings of hair around their necks. They all slept,
but Maol a’ Chliobain kept awake. During the night the giant got
thirsty. He called to his bald rough-skinned lad to bring him
water. The bald rough-skinned lad said that there was not a drop
within. “Kill,” said he, “one of the strange girls, and bring me
her blood.” “How will I know them?” said the bald rough-skinned
lad. “There are turns of beads about the necks of my
daughters, and turns of hair about the necks of the rest.” Maol
a’ Chliobain heard the giant, and as quickly as she could she put
the strings of hair that were about her own neck and the necks of
her sisters about the necks of the giant’s daughters, and the beads
that were about the necks of the giant’s daughters about her own
neck and the necks of her sisters, and laid herself quietly down.
The bald rough-skinned lad came and killed one of the daughters
of the giant, and brought him her blood. He bade him bring him
more. He killed the second one. He bade him bring him more,
and he killed the third. Maol a’ Chliobain wakened her sisters,
and she took them on her back and went away. The giant observed
her, and he followed her.</p>

<p>The sparks of fire which she was driving out of the stones with
her heels were striking the giant in the chin, and the sparks of fire
that the giant was taking out of the stones with the points of his
feet, they were striking Maol a’ Chliobain in the back of her head.
It was thus with them until they reached a river. Maol a’ Chliobain
leaped the river, and the giant could not leap the river. “You
are over, Maol a’ Chliobain.” “Yes, if it vex you.” “You killed
my three bald red-skinned daughters.” “Yes, if it vex you.”
“And when will you come again?” “I will come when my
business brings me,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The tale is a good deal longer; but the above portion will give
an idea of the style and manner of the whole. Unlike many of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
ballads, the language of these tales is thoroughly popular. Mr
Campbell had in his possession, besides what he published, much
material deposited after his recent death in the Advocates’
Library.</p>

<p><em>A Popular Rhyme</em>, frequently occurring in the tales, is a great
favourite as a boat song. It fills the same place in the popular
romances that the “Banners” does in the heroic ballads. The
original will be found in the second volume of Campbell’s “Tales,”
and is regarded as very old. “The vigorous and elastic spirit
that pervades the following verses must have strung the heart of
many a hardy mariner who loved to feel the fresh and briny breeze
driving his snoring Birlinn, bounding like a living creature over
the tumbling billows of the inland loch, or the huge swell of the
majestic main.” Pattison translates <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">We turned her prow unto the sea, her stern unto the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And first we raised the tall, tough masts, and then the canvas hoar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fast filled our towering, cloud-like sails, for the wind came from the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And such a wind as we might choose, were the winds at our command:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A breeze that rushing down the hill would strip the blooming heather,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or rustling through the green-clad grove, would whirl its leaves together.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It heaped the ruins on the land, though sire and sire stood by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They could no help afford, but gaze with wan and troubled eye!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A flap, a flash, the green roll dashed, and laughed against the red;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon our boards, now here, now there, it knocked its foamy head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dun bowed whilk in the abyss, as on the galley bore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave a tap upon her gunwale and a slap upon her floor.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She could have split a slender straw—so clean and so well she went—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As still obedient to the helm her stately course she bent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We watched the big beast eat the small—the small beast nimbly fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And listen to the plunging eels—the sea-gulls’ clang on high—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We had no other music to cheer us on our way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till round those sheltering hills we passed, and anchored in this bay.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the hero or heroes of the tale had to undertake a sea
voyage this rhyme was invariably introduced by the reciter as a fit
description of how it was accomplished. <i lang="gd">Ghearradh i cuinnlein
caol coirce le feabhas a stiuraidh</i> appears to have been the highest
conception of skilful steering, and we may readily believe that it
would be hard to surpass such a marvellous feat. Much complaint
has been made against these same “lying, worldly stories,” which
the good bishop Carsuel found obstructing his reforming efforts.
Several of his profession since have uttered the same complaint.
But surely if the minds of the people were not filled with a better
gospel, the wisest thing they could do was to extract any lessons of
prudence and morality that they could find in these simple tales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>As to the preservation and age of these romances the question
is excellently stated in the following sentences by <a id="tn-130">Standish O’Grady</a>:
“Whatever it may be that has given vitality to the traditions of
the mythic and elder historic period, they have survived to modern
times; when they have been formed into large manuscript collections,
of which the commonest titles, ‘Bolg an t-Salathair,’ answering
to a ‘Comprehensive Miscellany.’ These were for the most
part written by professional scribes and schoolmasters, and being
then lent to, or bought by those who could read, but had no leisure
to write, used to be read aloud in farmer’s houses on occasions when
numbers were collected at some employment, such as wool-carding
in the evenings; but especially at wakes. Thus the people became
familiar with all these tales. The writer has heard a man who
never possessed a manuscript, nor heard of O’Flanagan’s publication,
relate at the fireside the death of the sons of Uisneach without
omitting one adventure, and in great part retaining the very
words of the written versions.” “It has been already said that
some of these legends and poems are new versions of old; but it
is not to be supposed that they are so in at all the same degree or
the same sense as, for instance, the modernised <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>
are of Chaucer’s original work. There is this great difference,
that in the former, nothing has been changed but some inflections
and constructions, and the orthography which has become more
fixed; the genius and idiom of the language, and in a very great
measure the words, remaining the same; while in the latter all
these have been much altered. Again the new versions of Chaucer
are of the present day; whereas our tales and poems, both the
modifications of older ones, and those which in their very origin
are recent, are one with the other, most probably three hundred
years old.”</p>

<p>It was the authors, writers, and preservers of these tales and
romances that manufactured and handed down to us the fabulous
chronicles in which the early migrations and history of the Gaelic
clans lie embedded. Let us cast a glance at these interesting
chronicles, the historical value of which has not yet been decided
by our Celtic literati.</p>

<p>It has been a question much discussed, how the British islands
were first peopled; whether some other nameless tribes landed
before the Celts; and in what manner the Celts came into possession.
It is admitted by some Cymri in traditions that their
brother Gaels were before them, whoever had been in possession
before the Gaels. Hu the Mighty, the great ancestor of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Welsh, being a wise ruler, entered into federal relations with the
Gaels on his arrival, the land being extensive enough for the two
Celtic tribes. This Hu Gadarn, who is said to have come with
his people direct from the regions round about “where Constantinople
now is,” is thus described in the poetry of his <span class="nowrap">country:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“The mighty Hu with mead would pay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bard for his melodious lay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Emperor of land and sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And of all living things was he.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Irish annalists make a certain Milesius and others leaders of the
Gaelic colonies by which Ireland was peopled. These colonies
came from the East, and having rested in Spain, they sailed thence
directly to Ireland. There are many historical romances extant
regarding these colonies of Gaels and their wanderings and final
settlement in Ireland. “The Chronicles of Eri” is among the
most interesting. Dr Keating, in his legendary history of Ireland,
gives the descent of the Gael from Gathelus, or <i lang="gd">Gaidheal Glas</i>, as
follows:—Gathelus, who started westward from Egypt, was the son
of Niul, son of Fenius Farsa, son of Baath, son of Magog, son of
Japhet, son of Noah! The force of reason could no further go.
Niul was a man of much learning and wisdom, and was married to
a daughter of Pharaoh, called Scoto. She was the mother of
Gathelus, who, it is said, was an intimate friend of Moses. When
the great exodus of Israel from Egypt took place Gathelus was in
his eightieth year. After various adventures his descendants
arrived in Spain, where they remained for some time masters of
the country. Milidh or Milesius was an eminent warrior; greatly
distinguished himself before leaving Egypt in a war with the
Ethiopians; fought in Scythia, and became one of the kings of the
descendants of Gathelus in Spain. He also was married to a Scota,
a daughter of Pharaoh. His sons, in the year 500 before Christ,
sailed to Ireland with a fleet of thirty vessels. They soon conquered
the Tuatha de Danaan, and divided Ireland into two parts.
Ebir was made king of the southern part of the island, and Eremon
of the northern part.</p>

<p>The descendants of Gathelus in all their wanderings are supposed
to have carried with them Jacob’s Stone, the famous <i lang="gd">Lia Fail</i>, or
stone of destiny, stolen from Scone by that royal robber of Scotch
antiquities, Edward I., now in the coronation chair <a id="tn-131">in Westminster</a>
Abbey. It is alleged that it was removed from Ireland to Scotland
in 503 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> by Murtogh MacEarc that his brother Fergus Mor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
might be crowned on it. Science makes havoc at times with
tradition. After examining the <i lang="gd">Lia Fail</i>, Professor Geikie, according
to Dr Skene, declares that it is merely a block of Perthshire
sandstone. At the same time, it must be a stone of great antiquity,
and lies at last in a safe and honourable resting-place, at
whose shrine, and before the mightiest and most beloved Monarch
that ever sat on an earthly throne, Celt and Saxon, Dane and
Norman, bend the knee in loyal unity. There is an interesting
prophecy of a very ancient origin connected with the <i lang="gd">Lia Fail</i>.
O’Hartigan, an Irish poet, who died in 975, speaks of it in the following
<span class="nowrap">couplet—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0" lang="gd">An cloch a ta fam dha shail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0" lang="gd">Uaithe raidhtear Inis Fail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The stone beneath my two heels,</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>From it, is said, the Isle of Fail.</em></div>
</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ni fallat fatum, Scoti, qnocunque locatum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Of which Keating gives the following <span class="nowrap">Gaelic:—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So much for the <i lang="gd">Lia Fail</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is a reluctance on the part of Irish writers to accept any
theory that implies the colonisation of Ireland from Britain. On
the contrary, they rather attempt to prove that the Scottish Gael
emigrated from Ireland—a theory which appears to have been
invented in the fifteenth century. It was afterwards adopted unquestioningly
by Scottish antiquarians, with few exceptions, of
whom James Macpherson of Ossianic fame was one. For some
time the Highlanders generally accepted the theory, and almost
all the Highland clans were somehow or other traced to an Irish
original. <i lang="gd">MacMhaighstir Alastair</i> thus sings of the original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
country of the clans according to the belief of last <span class="nowrap">century:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“There are thousands now in Alba</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As stout as are in any land;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The grey Gaels from Scota</em>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who cheerful round your colours stand.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By <em>Scota</em> Ireland is meant. All the elaborate and romantic
chronicles by which Milesian and Spanish colonies are made to
land on Irish soil were mostly manufactured by monks in the
Middle Ages, and have no defensible historical foundation; the
same may be affirmed of the alleged colonisation of Argyllshire by
Irish Gaels.</p>

<p>Some of the romances and the chronicles, however, suggest what
appear to be reliable facts respecting the several races of Erin and
Albin. Just as there were several tribes of Finians in ancient Eire,
so there are different tribes of Celts in modern Ireland. A powerful
pre-Celtic element, as in the north-west of Scotland, prevails
in the south-west of Ireland. On the other hand a Norse element
also prevails in the north-west of Scotland, which has largely
entered into the population of the north of Ireland. The difference
of character exhibited by the generic Irish and generic Scottish
Celt is to be traced no doubt to the degrees of original difference
in the blending of races.</p>

<p>The Norse element has always been recognised by the more
intelligent of the Highlanders. We find Mary MacLeod, the
Harris poetess, born in 1569, addressing the Dunvegan chief of
the day in these <span class="nowrap">words:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“In counsel or fight, thy kindred</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Know these should be thine—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Branch of <em>Lochlin’s</em> wide-ruling</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And king-bearing line!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in Erin they know it</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Far over the brine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No Earl would in Albin</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy friendship decline.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The matter of religion is, no doubt, an important factor in the
later difference; but the sturdier Norse element in the Highlander’s
constitution may account for much. In reading the literature of
the two countries, we are at once struck with the different keys
to which the bards attune their harps. An Irish bard, in English,
sings thus of his <span class="nowrap">country:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“She sits alone on the cold gravestone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And only the dead are nigh her;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the tongue of the Gael she makes her wail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The night wind rushes by her:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“‘Few, O few, are the leal and true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And fewer shall be, and fewer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The land is a corse;—no life, no force—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">O wind with sere leaves strew her!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“‘Men ask what scope is left for hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To one who has known her story;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I trust her dead! Their graves are red;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But their souls are with God in glory.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This note is not to be found in the whole range of Highland
poetry. Perhaps it is because the retrospect of the past is not so
full of sadness for the Highlander, who, notwithstanding his rebellions
and their frequent non-success, has fairly maintained his
ground in Scotland. He has had his share in the struggles for
Scotland’s independence; and he now identifies himself with the
whole nation, proud of the name, and rejoicing in her glorious
history. The Jacobite bard, Alexander Macdonald, addresses the
Scottish Lion <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Hail! thou rending Lion,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Go rushing on where’s honour won—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For wild fight they’re never late.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With steady foot and agile hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To thrust or cut each weapon gleams;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Red on the ground death gasps around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But gay o’erhead the Lion streams.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou roaring, frowning Lion!” &amp;c.</div>

<p>This is the kind of poetry on which the Highland national spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
has been fed. Retrospects have less weight and prospects more
with the Highlander. On the other hand the Irish Gael dwells
intensely on the past, and thus grievously sins against his future. As
appendix to this chapter on prose romances, I give some Irish
<em>literary facts</em> and a Hibernian <em>picture of Ossian</em> in verse, as—</p>


<h3>IRISH VERSIONS.</h3>

<p>The early literature of the Scottish Gael cannot be well understood
apart from early Irish literature. The ballads of the two
countries describe the same struggles; the characters engaging in
the strife are the same, and bear the same names. So it ought to
be interesting to compare some of the idealised characters of early
Irish literature with those that we find in Scotland.</p>

<p>The early history of Ireland and its literature has not yet been
written, and the name remark is applicable to the Highlands of
Scotland. One able and scientific work has been recently produced
in the latter country—the learned three volumes of Dr W.
F. Skene—“Celtic Scotland.” The indefatigable labours of the
late Professor Eugone O’Curry have prepared the way for an
authentic history of Ireland; and it is to be hoped that such works
as those of the Gradys, Stokeses, &amp;c., will clear the ground
of fables and reveal the genuine lines of early Irish annals. In
his “Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish
History,” O’Curry remarks—“It will be found that all the writers
who have published books on the subject up to the time of delivering
these lectures—books some of them large and elaborate—<em>not
one</em> ever wrote who had previously acquired the necessary
qualifications, <em>or even applied himself at all to the necessary study</em>,
without which, as I think I have established beyond a doubt, the
history of Ireland could not possibly have been written. <em>All</em> were
ignorant, almost totally ignorant, of the greater part of the records
and remains of which I have here, for the first time, endeavoured
to present a comprehensive, and, in some sort, a connected
account.” Irish scholars have an immense mass of valuable
<a id="tn-135">ancient manuscripts</a> in which they find rich remains of their early
literature, as well as materials for their early history. Let us
mention some of the most important. Here is a list of some of
the old and middle Irish periods:—</p>

<p>A copy of the Four Gospels, stained with the blood of the Irish
St. Killian, who was martyred in 678 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; taken from his tomb in
743. In the library of Trinity College, Dublin, are found—A
Latin copy of the Four Gospels, written previous to 700 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Four Gospels of Dimma, Latin, with a few Gaelic words, 620 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>;
the Book of Durrow, containing the Four Latin Gospels, about 700
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the Book of Kells, same contents as last, about 800 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>;
the Gospel of St. Moling, about 800 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the Book of Armagh,
containing the Latin New Testament, notes on St. Patrick’s life,
and the life of St. Martin of Tours, 807 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the Book of Leinster,
containing the Cattle Raid of Cuailgne, and the Destruction of
Troy, 1150 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the Yellow Book of Lecain, 1391 <span class="allsmcap">A.D</span>; and the
Book of Brehon Laws—the last-named three books are in the
Irish language. In the Royal Irish Academy are the Book of the
Dun Cow, also containing the Cattle Raid, 1106 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the Book
of Ballymote, 1391 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; also a copy of the Book of Lecain, 1416
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> These are all in the Irish language. Earlier dates than
those given have been assigned to some of these books. These
and the Annals of Loch Cè, the Annals of the Four Masters, the
Annals of Tighernac, &amp;c., are all of great interest and value to
Gaelic scholars in Scotland. The ancient Celtic literature extant
in Scotland cannot be at all compared in extent with that preserved
in Ireland.</p>

<p>As already remarked, the picture of Ossian that the Irish ballads
and tales present resembles that of the ballads and tales of Scotland.
In the fourth volume of the Transactions of the Ossianic
Society of Dublin, we find a description of the journey and residence
of Ossian in <i lang="gd">Tir-nan-Og</i>, “The Land of Youth.” In
Scotland this place is known as <i lang="gd">Eilein-na-h-Oige</i>, “The Isle of
Youth.” Ossian and the rest of the Fianna were “hunting on a
misty morning nigh the bordering shores of Loch Léin,” when a
fleet rider was seen advancing towards <span class="nowrap">them—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“A young maiden of most beautiful appearance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On a slender white steed of swiftest power.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The name of this maiden is “Niamh,” and she describes herself
as the “fair daughter of the King of Youth.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“A royal crown was on her head;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a brown mantle of precious silk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spangled with stars of red gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Covering her shoes down to the grass.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“A garment, wide, long, and smooth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Covered the white steed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a comely saddle of red gold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her light hand held a bridle with a golden bit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In answer to Fingal’s inquiry she says that, “as yet she has not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
been spoken of with any man,” but that “her affection and love
she has given to his son”—Ossian. In these ballads and tales
“<span lang="gd">geasan</span>,” some bewitching obligations or bonds, are frequently
spoken of. It was by the exercise of this power—these invisible
bonds—that the faithless spouse of Fingal compelled the beautiful
Diarmad to elope with her. This Princess, “the golden-headed
Niamh,” put her “<span lang="gd">geasan</span>” on Ossian. She thus addresses
<span class="nowrap">him:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Obligations unresisted by true heroes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O! generous Oisin, I put upon thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To come with myself now upon my steed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till we arrive at the ‘Land of Youth.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“It is the most delightful country to be found,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of greatest repute under the sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trees dropping with fruit and blossom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And foiliage growing on the tops of boughs.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Abundant there are honey and wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And everything that eye has beheld,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There will not come decline on thee with lapse of time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Death or decay thou wilt not see.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He is to get there a “hundred swords,” and a hundred of every
article or possession that could be dear to the heart of a warrior or
a bard. Ossian thus <span class="nowrap">replies:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“No refusal will I give from me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O charming queen of the golden curls!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art my choice above the women of the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I will go with willingness to the ‘Land of Youth.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The poet then describes in melancholy strains his parting with his
own people—the <span class="nowrap">Féinne:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I kissed my father sweetly and gently,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the same affection I got from him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I bade adieu to all the Fianna,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the tears flowed down my cheeks.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Many a delightful day had Fionn and I,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Fianna with us in great power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Been <em>chess-playing</em> and drinking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hearing music—the last that was powerful?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“A hunting in smooth valleys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And our sweet-mouthed dogs with us there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At other times, in the rough conflict,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slaughtering heroes with great vigour.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Macpherson’s Ossian is never caught at “chess-playing,” or speaking
of other things that might savour of more recent days. The
course of Ossian and Niamh is thus <span class="nowrap">described:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“We turned our backs to the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And our faces directly due west;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The smooth sea ebbed before us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And filled in billows after us.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Before they arrive at the “Land of Youth,” Ossian rescues a
distressed Princess from the hated hands of a giant; and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“We buried the great man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a deep sod-grave, wide and clear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I raised his flag and monument,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I wrote his name in Ogham Cráobh.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They are welcomed to the “Land of Youth” by a “multitude of
glittering bright hosts,” and conducted to a Royal fortress, by
whose side are <span class="nowrap">seen—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Radiant summer-houses and palaces,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made all of precious stones.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“When all arrived in one spot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then courteously spoke the ‘King of Youth,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And said, ‘This is Ossin,’ the son of Fionn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gentle consort of ‘golden-headed Niamh!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He spent a long time in the “Land of Youth;” but in the midst
of its calm, waveless existence, he longs for his old life with the
Féinne, and for a sight once more of his lost <span class="nowrap">brothers-in-arms:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I asked leave of the King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And of my kind spouse—golden-headed Niamh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To go to Erinn back again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see Fionn and his great host.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She reluctantly consents to Ossian’s return; and the parting is
bitterly sad to <span class="nowrap">both:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I looked up into her countenance with compassion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And streams of tears run from my eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Patrick! thou wouldest have pitied her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tearing the hair of the golden head.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She warns him on his return never to alight off the white steed, <span class="nowrap">or—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Thou wilt be an old man, withered and blind.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">On his arrival in Erin he sought, with a doubtful and trembling
heart, for the Fianna. He soon met a great troop of men and
women, who saluted him kindly, and were surprised at the bulk of
his person, his form, and appearance. He asked them whether
Fionn was alive, and whether any disaster had swept the Fianna
away. He was told that a “young maiden” came for Fionn, and
that he went away with her to the “Land of <span class="nowrap">Youth:”—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“When I mysel heard that report,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Fionn did not live, nor any of the Fianna,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was seized with weariness and great sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I was full of melancholy after them.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The poet immediately betakes himself to “Almhuin” of great
exploits in broad Leinster; but could not see the “Court of
Fionn,” <span class="nowrap">and—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“There was not in its place in truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But weeds, chick-weeds, and nettles.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">While passing through the Glen of the Thrushes he sees three
hundred men before him: their leader cries for help to the bard,
whose chivalrous instincts are roused, and who, forgetting the strict
injunctions of Niamh not to touch the earth, alighted and relieved
them from their difficulty, performing the most marvellous exploits.
But <span class="nowrap">alas!—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“No sooner did I come down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than the white steed took fright;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He went then on his way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I, in sorrow, both weak and feeble.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He had been a long time in the “Land of Youth,” and intended
going back to that country, perpetually “under the full bloom;”
but now he could not. His stay in that land reminds us of the
seven sleepers of Ephesus. He tells the everlastingly occurring
<span class="nowrap">Patrick—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I spent a time protracted in length,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three hundred years and more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until I thought ’twould be my desire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see Fionn and the Fianna alive.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The great prince-poet, as everywhere represented, is in his last
days poor and blind. After declaring to Patrick <span class="nowrap">that—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“There is many a book written down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the melodious sweet sages of the Gaels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which we in truth are unable to relate to thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the deeds of Fionn and of the Fianna;”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">he concludes his lengthy relation in these two <span class="nowrap">stanzas:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I lost the sight of my eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My form, my countenance, and my vigour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was an old man, poor and blind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without strength, understanding, or esteem.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Patrick! there is to thee my story,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it occurred to myself without a lie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My going and my adventures in certain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my returning from the ‘Land of Youth.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such is the picture we have of Ossian and his life in some of
the Irish ballads. There is no resemblance between this poetry
and that which Macpherson has given us. <i lang="gd">Oisin an Tirna-h-Oige</i>
is the production of a writer who lived not many centuries ago.
It is certainly much more modern than even the Oisian of the older
ballads, in which dialogues between the saint and the poet occur.</p>

<p>A very fine specimen of the old heroic poem of the Gael is the
Battle of <i lang="gd">Cnoc-an-air</i>. Here we have terrible fighting among the
“Seven battalions of the standing Fenians.” The Irish versions
of the dialogues between Patrick and Ossian are very much like
those of Scotland.</p>

<p class="p1">The unwise utterance of Dr Samuel Johnson that no Scottish
Gaelic manuscript of an older date than last century existed is
amply refuted by the catalogues of British, Irish, and Continental
Libraries. Private individuals also are in possession of Gaelic
manuscripts, some of which come to light now and then. In 1873
Admiral Macdonald sent to Mr J. F. Campbell of Islay the famous
<i lang="gd">Leabhar Dearg</i>, or Red Book of Clan-Ranald, which he had recovered.
This was one of the manuscripts which Macpherson
was supposed to have used and destroyed; but after having read
it in company with Mr Standish O’Grady, Mr Campbell declares
that this paper manuscript “does not contain one line of Macpherson’s
Ossian.” It is highly probable that many others may
have ancient manuscripts among their family archives like this one
of Admiral Macdonald, the supposed destruction of which by
Macpherson caused so much literary waste in connection with the
Ossianic controversy.</p>

<p>There have been in Scotland many influences—changes dynastic,
political, and ecclesiastical—unfavourable to the preservation
of our manuscripts. In the midst of these turbulent changes and
the ravages of wars, the vandal hands of foes that demolished
churches and burned houses would not spare the native literary
remains they might come across. We have lost much by the
ravages of the Norse in Iona, of the English at Scone, and of the
Reformers. But fresh access of national life came in each case.</p>

<p>It is not the intention of these chapters to describe at length the
MSS. that we have left us, but a few of the older ones may be
mentioned. The earliest, as already remarked, are to be found in
Continental Libraries—those on which Zeuss founded his “Grammatica<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
Celtica.” Some of them are no doubt Irish, but some of
them must have been also written by the missionaries who went
forth at that time from the College of Iona. The language and
MSS. of that period in Ireland and Scotland were of the same
character and were common property, and continued to be so to
a great extent till the period of the Reformation, which, as above
remarked, along with more violent political changes in Scotland
before then, helped to destroy relics of preceding ages.
The oldest Gaelic MS. extant in this country is a folio beautifully
written on parchment or vellum from the collection of the late
Major MacLauchlan of Kilbride. It is in the possession of the
Highland Society, and is marked Vo. A., No. I. It is supposed
to belong to the eighth century. The following remark is found
on the margin of the fourth leaf: —“<span lang="gd">Oidche bealtne ann a
coimhtech mo Pupu Muirciusa agus as olc lium nach marunn diol
in linesi dem bub Misi Fithil acc furnuidhe na scoile.</span>” It has
been thus rendered by the late Dr Donald Smith:—“The night of
the first of May, in Coenobium of my Pope Marchus, and I
regret that there is not left of my ink enough to fill up this line.
Jane Fithil, an attendant on the school.” The MS. “consists of a
poem, moral or religious, some short historical anecdotes, a critical
exposition of the <i lang="gd">Tain</i>, an Irish tale.”</p>

<p>One of the next oldest is named “Emanuel,” and is ascribed to
the ninth century. Thirty-five lines are quoted in the appendix of
the Highland Society’s report.</p>

<p>There is a parchment book that is attributed to the tenth or
eleventh century. It contains Biblical legends, a life of St. Columba,
&amp;c. It admits of no doubt that many Gaelic productions perished
in the eighth century, when Iona was sacked by the Norse. And
it is only a wonder that so many relics should have survived the
ruthless changes of those days.</p>

<p>Bishop Moore, of Norwich, afterwards of Ely, presented his
library, more than a century ago, to the University of Cambridge.
Among his large collection of books was a vellum MS. of 86 folios,
about six inches long by three broad. It is said that this MS. is as
old as the ninth century. The principal part of it is written in
Latin, and contains John’s Gospel and portions of the other three
Gospels, the Apostles’ Creed, and part of an Office for the visitation
of the sick. It belonged to an establishment of the Culdee
Church, and is an interesting relic of the Celtic learning and culture
of the time, particularly of the ecclesiastics of that Church,
who, while cultivating their native Gaelic, could also read and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
write Latin. To the Gaelic scholar the chief interest lies in the
Celtic portion of the MS.—the Gaelic entries made on the margin
and on other spaces in the volume. The MS. was published some
years ago by the Spalding Club, under the excellent editorship of
the late Dr John Stuart, who has given us the Gaelic entries as
well as the original in a scholarly and careful fashion. A Gaelic
paragraph on the founding of the old monastery of Deer has
attracted much attention, on account of its reference to Columba,
and because it shows the intimate connection that existed between
the parent establishment at Iona and branch establishments in
distant parts of Scotland.</p>

<p>The <em>Legend of Deer</em> is as follows:—</p>

<p>(Columcille and Drostán of Gosgrach his pupil came from I as God had
shown to them unto Abbordoboir and Bede the Pict was mormaer of Buchan
before them, and it was he that gave them that town in freedom for ever
from mormaer and tosech. They came after that to the other town, and it
was pleasing to Calumcille, because it was full of God’s grace, and he asked
of the mormaer to wit Bede that he should give it to him; and he did not
give it; and a son of his took an illness after [or in consequence of] refusing
the clerics, and he was nearly dead [lit. he was dead but if it were a little.]
After this the mormaer went to entreat the clerics that they should pray
for the son that health should come to him, and he gave in offering to them
from Cloch in tiprat to Cloch pette mic Garnait. They made the prayer,
and health came to him. After that Calumcille gave to Drostán that town

<p>According to this legend it seems that King Brude’s court at
Inverness was not the only distant place visited by the Iona
Apostle, but that he also went as far east as the district of Buchan.
The other chief Gaelic entries are records of grants of land made
by the Monastery. The majority of the names entered, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
mere patronymics then, became some time after clan names as
understood at the present day. It was then or very soon after that
the ancient inhabitants of Celtic Albin began to form themselves
into clans in the state in which they were found two centuries ago.
The systems of feudalism and clanship began to blend and develop.
Towards the end of the MS. the following interesting Gaelic
entry is found:—“<span lang="gd">Forchubus caichduini imbia arrath in lebran
colli aratardda bendacht foranmain in truagan rodscribai.</span>” This
has been translated by the distinguished Celtic scholar Dr Whitley
Stokes thus—“Be it on the conscience of every one in whom
shall be for grace the booklet with splendour; that he give a blessing
on the soul of the wretchock who wrote it.” The same eminent
authority says—“In point of language this is identical with the
oldest Irish glosses in Zeuss’s <cite lang="la">Grammatica Celtica</cite>.” This precisely
proves what has been elsewhere already stated, that the Gaelic of
Scotland and Ireland at that time was exactly the same, and that
it was at a later period that dialectic differences appeared. It also
suggests that many of old existing MSS. might have been written
by Scotchmen as well as by Irishmen.</p>

<p>The most ancient and authentic record of the Scottish Kings is
to be found in a poem called “The Albannic Duan,” which was
recited by the Gaelic bard-laureate of the day at the coronation of
Malcolm III. It was found originally in the MacFirbis Manuscript
in the Royal Irish Academy. The name of the author is
not known. The Duan consists of one hundred and eight lines,
and is composed in the ballad measure. Being mostly a catalogue
of names, it does not bear a verse translation very well. The first
four stanzas run <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<p>It was probably in this reign that the ancient language of Albin
ceased to be used in the Royal Court of Scotland. It continued,
however, to be the fashionable speech of the provincial princes of
the Isles until the lordship of the Isles terminated, towards the end
of the sixteenth century, with Angus MacDonald of Duneevaig,
Islay, and the Glens in Antrim. Sir James Macdonald of Antrim,
who had no English, came with a magnificent retinue to visit
James IV. of Scotland at Holyrood previous to his ascending the
throne of England, and stopped for some time at Court. Could
the King, with whom Sir James was a great favourite, and to whom
he was closely related, converse with him in the Gaelic language?</p>

<p>There is a parchment manuscript in quarto that belonged to the
Kilbride collection. It is prettily written, and contains a metrical
account or list of holidays, festivals, and saints’ days throughout

Galen, &amp;c.; the Schola Salernitana in Leonine verse, drawn up
about 1100 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, for the use of Robert, Duke of Normandy, the

<p class="noindent">Having the words <i lang="gd">Leabhar Giollacholaim Meigleathadh</i> on the last
page of the MS., it is supposed that it belonged to Malcolm
Bethune, a member of a family distinguished for their learning and
medical skill, that supplied for many ages with physicians the
Western Isles of Scotland. It was one of them, Fergus Mac Beth
or Beaton, that signed the holograph, of the famous Islay Charter
of 1408 for Donald, Lord of the Isles. A MS. dated 1238 on the
cover is supposed to have been written at Glenmason, in Cowal.
It contains tales in prose and verse—one about <i lang="gd">Deardri</i>, <i lang="gd">Dearduil</i>,
or <i lang="gd">Darthula</i>.</p>

<p>Another valuable and interesting MS., dated 1512-26, belonging
to Sir James Macgregor, Dean of Lismore—“<span lang="la">Jacobus M’Gregor
decanus Lismorensis</span>”—has been mostly published. The editors
who have done their work admirably, have been Dr Thomas MacLauchlan
and Dr W. F. Skene. The work of the former was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
difficult and laborious—first to change the orthography of the
Dean, which was phonetic, into modern Gaelic, and then give a
literal English translation.</p>

<p>Among other known manuscripts of the period is that of
Dunstaffnage, October 12, 1603, by Ewen Macphaill. It contains
prose tales concerning Lochlin and Finnic heroes.</p>

<p>A paper manuscript 1654-5, by Edmond MacLauchlan, contains
sonnets, odes, epistles, and an ogham alphabet at the end.</p>

<p>A quarto paper manuscript of 1690-91 contains ancient and
modern tales and poems. It was written at Ardchonnail, on Lochawe
side, by Ewen Maclean for Colin Campbell—“<i lang="gd">Caillain
Caimpbel leis an leis an leabharan</i>.” This Gaelic inscription appears
on the seventy-ninth leaf of the manuscript.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we have arrived at a
period in which Gaelic is very generally written. To the latter
century belong the most of the manuscript materials extant. The
subjects of these manuscripts are of the most various descriptions.
We have among them compendiums of theology, fables and
anecdotes about saints, &amp;c. The most valuable, perhaps, are the
genealogical manuscripts. The historian of Scottish annals is not
sufficiently equipped without knowledge of these. Some of them
no doubt, being family records very frequently, are very partial;
but when collated the one will correct the other. Other subjects
treated of in these manuscripts are medicine and astrology. The
substance of these is translated from Greek and Moorish works,
Galen, Averroes, and Avicenna being the general sources. The
largest number of the medical manuscripts were written by or
passed through the hands of the Beatons, the well-known physicians
of the western isles. Astrology appears to have been studied by
the aid of Arabian writers; so many of the superstitions or popular
ideas in the Highlands regarding the stars had probably an Arabic,
and not a Druidic origin, as the present Highlanders generally
believe. The surprising thing is that this science of the period
should be known and cultivated in such inaccessible places as the
Highlands and Islands. Dr MacLauchlan very pertinently and
truly remarks as follows:—“The metaphysical discussions [of the
MSS.], if they may be so called, are very curious, being characterised
by the features which distinguished the <a id="tn-146">science of metaphysics</a>
at the time. The most remarkable thing is there are Gaelic terms
to express the most abstract ideas in metaphysics—terms which
are now obsolete, and would not be understood by any ordinary
Gaelic speaker. A perusal of these ancient writings shows how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
much the language has declined, and to what an extent it was
cultivated at an early period. So with astrology, its terms are
translated and the science is fully set forth. Tables are furnished
of the position of the stars, by means of which to foretell the
character of future events. Whatever literature existed in Europe
in the 14th and 15th centuries extended its influence to the Scottish
Highlands. The nation was by no means in such a state of
barbarism as some writers would lead us to expect. They had
legal forms, for we have a formal legal charter of lands written in
Gaelic; they had medical men of skill and acquirement; they had
writers on law and theology, and they had men skilled in architecture
and sculpture.” But then these manuscripts, these evidences
of light and culture among the Gaels of the Middle Ages, were
buried in private and public libraries till some years ago; and
historians and others not suspecting their existence did not look
for them; and so wrote what their fancy dictated concerning the
barbaric Gael.</p>

<p>In examining the older MSS. and assigning them a nationality,
the student of Celtic literature must bear in mind that the language
spoken in the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland in early times
was exactly the same, and that the dialectic differences existing
just now have mostly developed since the period of the Reformation.
The literature that the two Gaelic peoples possessed till
then was also to a great extent common property. As to their
writing, what is called “Irish hand,” or vulgarly <em>Erse</em>, or “Irish
character,” is nothing more than what was once common throughout
the whole of Europe. It was in it Gaelic writers once wrote
in Scotland; and thus is how some of our early MSS. have been
assigned an Irish origin.</p>

<p>With the reign of Malcolm III., or <i lang="gd">Ceann-Mor</i>, in the eleventh
century, and his marriage with an English Princess, Scottish institutions
and habits began to be radically affected. The Anglicising
and Romanising processes at work were in their final stages in the
Lowlands about the time of the last invasion of the Norse in the
thirteenth century. Soon after the laws and customs of Scotland
were found quite transformed. Feudalism was introduced, and
began to extend even among the Highland chiefs and clans. The
system of clanship, although having apparent points of resemblance
to feudalism, was in principle essentially different. “In the former
case the people followed their chief as the head of their race, and
the representative of the common ancestor of the clan; in the
latter they obeyed their leader as feudal proprietor of the lands to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
which they were attached, and to whom they owed military service
for their respective portions of these lands. The Highland chief
was the hereditary lord of all who belonged to his clan wherever
they dwelt, or whatever lands they occupied; the feudal baron was
entitled to the military service of all <a id="tn-148">who held lands</a> under him,
to whatever race they might individually belong. The one dignity
was personal, the other was territorial; the rights of the chief were
inherent, those of the baron were accessory; the one might lose
or forfeit his possessions, but could not thereby be divested of his
hereditary character and privileges; the other when divested of
his fee ceased to have any title or claim to the service of those who
occupied the lands. Yet these two systems, so different in principle,
were in effect nearly identical. Both exhibited the spectacle
of a subject possessed of unlimited power within his own territories,
and exacting unqualified obedience from a numerous train of
followers, to whom he stood in the several relations of landlord,
military leader, and judge, with all the powers and prerogatives
belonging to each of those characters.” The system of clanship
was for a time better adapted for the Highlands; but the tendency
of both clanship and feudalism was to obstruct <a id="tn-148a">the administration</a>
of justice and impede the progress of improvement.</p>

<p>Let us now glance at the general culture of this period. From
the poetry of Finlay MacNab, in <cite>The Book of the Dean of Lismore</cite>,
we learn that the ancient bards were in the habit of writing their
compositions. Indeed there was far more literary culture among
the Gaels for many centuries before the Reformation than existed
for some time subsequent to that period. As in earlier ages there
was close intercourse in literary matters carried on during the
period of the Kingdom of the Isles between the Highlands and
Ireland. There are many names, Irish and Scotch, well known
in literary annals, to be found in the Highlands at this time. The
Beatons, originally O’Neils or MacNeills, were a family of learned
physicians in Islay and Mull. Manuscripts, either written by them
or in their possession, are still in existence. The MacVurichs,
descendants of Muireadhach Albannach, who were hereditary
senachies or bards to Clanranald, preserved the literary torch
lighted for generations in the Western Isles. Some of them are
said “to have received their education in Irish Colleges of poetry
and writing.” On the other hand it seems to have been a general
practice for Irish scholars to come to the Highlands, where they
and their writings were well received and well known. Irish
annals inform us of Irish scholars who were regarded as masters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
in the Highlands. These are the names of four of them:—</p>

<p>In 1185 died Maclosa O’Daly, ollave or scholar, a poet of Erin
and Albin. He was famed for his poetry, hospitality and nobility.</p>

<p>In 1328 died blind O’Carril, chief minstrel of Erin and Albin in
his day.</p>

<p>In 1448 died Tadgog, son of Tadg, son of Giollacoluim
O’Higgin, chief preceptor of the poets of Erin and Albin.</p>

<p>In 1554 died Tagd, son of Aodh O’Coffey, chief teacher of
poetry in Erin and Albin.</p>

<p>From this we learn that literature existed, and that it was sedulously
cultivated both in the Highlands and in Ireland at this time;
and we also learn how much influence the one country exercised
on the language and literature of the other.</p>

<p>During this period Gaelic scholars and culture were encouraged
and fostered by the Princes, afterwards the Lords of the Isles.
These Princes were also very liberal in their benefactions to the
Church; it was one of them, the great Somerled, that endowed
the Abbey of Paisley. Iona and other places over which their
sway extended had always their constant help. And thus in their
patronage of churchmen they afforded shelter and protection to
literature. The MacVurichs and the Beatons, already mentioned,
were at one time their secretaries and senachies or clan-historians.
Having in course of time extensive possessions in Ireland as well
as in Scotland, much intercourse was maintained between the
two countries, bards and scholars of both countries going and
coming in their train. The most distinguished of them after
Somerled were Donald, from whom the clan, Donald Bulloch, with
his brother John Mor, and James Macdonald the last of the Isles
who thus signs his name in a missive to the Irish Privy Council,
on January 24, 1546:—“James M’Connail of Dunnewaik and ye
Glinnis, and aperand aeyr of ye Yllis.” The Macdonalds, at one
time or another, as Princes or Lords of the Isles, ruled for upwards
of five centuries of the historical period over nearly the half of
Scotland and part of the north of Ireland. They occupy a prominent
place in Norse, Irish, and Scottish history. The Macdonalds
finally lost all their lands in the West, the most of which passed
into the hands of their powerful rivals the <span class="nowrap">Campbells:—</span></p>

<p>The name that stands first on the roll of the bards of the Middle
and Modern Ages is that of <span class="smcap" lang="gd">Muireadach Albannach</span>. He is
the author of several poems which have been preserved in <cite>The
Book of the Dean of Lismore</cite>. Religious subjects are the theme of
all his compositions. None of the old bards exhibits so much
earnestness and intensity of feeling. There is also more subjectivity
in his poems than in other productions of the period. His
name signifies Murdoch of Albin, or Scotland, given probably to
distinguish him from another Irish bard of the same name. Muireadhach
became the ancestor of a family of senachies and bards
who have been very distinguished in the literary annals of Gaelic
Scotland. They were hereditary bards and senachies to the Clanranald
family. One of them, Lachlan Mòr MacMhuireadhach or
Vurich, accompanied Donald Balloch of the Isles in 1411 at the
battle of Harlaw, reciting his grand war-incitement poem. The
last of them, Lachlan MacVurich, gives evidence in the report of
the Highland Society on Ossian, and traces his genealogy through
eighteen generations to Muireadhach Albannach. Muireadhach
appears to have lived between <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1180 and 1220. I give here a
metrical version of a short religious poem of his in the Dean of
Lismore’s book. He is supposed to have been an ecclesiastic, as
many of those who wrote in early times were.</p>

<p class="noindent">Another poem of Muireadhach is a curious dialogue between himself
and Cathal Cròdhearg, King of Connaught, who lived towards
the end of the 12th century. Both of them were then entering on
a monastic life. It has been inferred from the dialogue that
Murdoch was a man of high birth. Another poem of his in the

<p>Muireadhach Albannach occupies the same relation to a
number of succeeding generations of bards in Scotland that the
famous Dafydd ap Gwilym (born, 1293) does towards succeeding
Welsh bards.</p>

<p>We have a specimen of the written Gaelic of this period in the
famous Macdonald charter, the earliest Gaelic one extant. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
1408 Donald, Lord of the Isles, granted lands in Islay to Brian
Vicar Mackay of Rhinns, in that Island. The Mackays were an
old family in Islay; from them came the Magees of Ireland, and
I believe the present Bishop of Peterborough. The lands were
Baile-Vicar, Cornobus, Cracobus, Tocamol, &amp;c., in the parish of
Kildalton. The charter conveying these lands, still in existence,
is written in Gaelic. It was published some time ago by the
Record Commission. It is an interesting document, and is here
given in a literal translation. It was written by one of the
Beatons, already referred to, who signs himself “Fergus M’Beth.”
He was probably at the time physician to the Lord of the Isles.
As Dr M’Lauchlan, who deciphered it, says—“The style of the
charter is that of the usual feudal charters written in Latin, but the
remarkable thing is to find a document of the kind written in Gaelic,
at a time when such a thing was almost unknown in the Saxon
dialects of either England or Scotland.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that the Gaelic of the charter, written
470 years ago, is the same as that spoken in Islay at the present
day. One word <i lang="gd">brach</i>, “ever” is spelt phonetically, just as it is
pronounced now in the dialect of the island. The only word
which seems to have changed its signification is <i lang="gd">bheatha</i>, or unaspirated
<i lang="gd">beatha</i>, which was then used for “world.” <i lang="gd">Beatha</i> in
modern Gaelic means life, but an older form was <i lang="gd">bith</i>, which now
means being or existence, but in ancient Gaelic was used for
“world.” See <cite>Zeuss’s Grammar</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">In the name of God. Amen.</p>

<p>I, Mac Donald, am granting and giving eleven marks and a-half of land
from myself and from my heirs, to Brian Vicar Mackay and to his heirs,
after him for ever and ever, for his services ... to myself and to my
father before me; and this on covenant and on condition that he himself
and they shall give to me and to my heirs after me yearly, four cows fit for
killing for my house. And in case that these cows shall not be found, the
above Brian and his heirs shall give to me and to my heirs after me, two
marks and forty for the same above cows. And for the same cause I am
binding myself and binding my heirs after me, to the end of the world, these
lands, together with their fruit of sea and land, to defend and maintain to
the above Brian Vicar Mackay, and to his heirs for ever after him in like
manner. And these are the lands I have given to him and to his heirs for
ever—namely, Baile-Vicar, Machaire, Leargariabhoighe, Ciontragha, Graftol,
Tocamol, Ugasgog, the two Gleannastol, Cracobus, Cornubus, and Baile-Neaghtoin.
And in order that there may be meaning, force, and effect in
this grant I give from me, I again bind myself and my heirs for ever under
covenant this to uphold and fulfil to the aforesaid Brian and his heirs after
him to the end of the world, by putting my hand and my seal down here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>

</div>

<p>It is a suggestive commentary on the uncertainty of sublunary
things that these lands which Donald was to “uphold” “to the
end of the world” to Brian and his heirs have passed through the
hands of more than one family since—they being now the property
of John Ramsay, of Kildalton. Neither a Mackay nor a Macdonald
owns any land in Islay now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lachlan Mor MacVurich.</span>—This senachie and bard to the
Clanranald is the author of one of the most extraordinary poems
in Gaelic or in any language. He was of the family of the famous
Muireadhach Albannach. He accompanied Donald, Lord of the
Isles, at the battle of Harlaw, in 1411, and rehearsed his poem to
animate the followers of the Islay chief. This war-song or battle-incitement
(Stewart’s Collection) consists of three hundred and
thirty-eight lines. The theme of the production is “O, children
of Conn of the Hundred Fights! remember hardihood in the time
of battle.” Round this subject Lachlan Mòr has gathered some
six hundred and fifty adverbial adjectives, arranged alphabetically,
and every one of them bearing specially and martially on the great
theme of the song. There is nothing in the poem but these adjectives,
which certainly in themselves are not very poetical; but
rehearsed unhesitatingly from a good memory “in all their astonishing
alliterative array by a ready speaker gifted with a strong and
sensitive voice, they could not but have offered a rare opportunity
for impetuous, vehement, and effective declamation.”</p>

<p>It may be remarked here, <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, that there is no decisive
evidence for the assertions of historians that Donald of Islay lost
that battle. He claimed the victory; but even although it were
more decided it would be equally barren of important results. It
is also a misconception of the character of the forces engaged when
it is said that one side was Celtic and the other Saxon, and that
it was a struggle for race supremacy. There were many Gaels on
the other side also, just as there were in the last battle fought on
British ground—that of Culloden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Four Wise Men.</span>—One of the most interesting poems in
the <cite>Book of the Dean of Lismore</cite> is a dialogue between four men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
who are supposed to stand at the grave of Alexander the Great.
It appears to be somewhat older than the fifteenth or sixteenth
century. It illustrates the strong masculine character of those
earlier ballads, where sense is not buried under a heap of verbiage.
Whoever the author was, he was evidently a man of sound judgment
and cultured common sense. Being of more than average
merit in the original, the poem bears translation better than other
inferior productions in the Dean’s Book. It has been excellently
done by the late Mr Thomas Pattison, and I avail myself of his
version. It is very interesting to read the moralisings of Highlanders
some five hundred years ago.</p>

<p>In the Dean’s Book we have poems by two ladies—the first
Gaelic poetesses of whom we have any record. The name of one
of them is <span class="smcap">Efric MacCorqudale</span> or <span class="smcap">MacNeill</span>. This poetess,
whose name is written “<span lang="gd">Effric neyn corgitill</span>,” is the authoress of
a very spirited poem. She appears to have been the wife of the
last MacNeill of Castle Sween, an ancient strong-hold at the mouth
of Loch Sween in Knapdale, Argyllshire. The last constable of
this clan was Hector MacTorquil MacNeill, whose name is found
on a Macdonald charter in 1472. He was of the Gigha MacNeills,
who sprung from Torquil MacNeill, designated “<span lang="la">filius Nigelli</span>” in
his charter of the lands of Gigha and Taynish with the constabulary
of Castle Sween. “MacTorquil,” half Gaelic, half Norse,
reminds us of the mixture of Teutonic and Celtic blood in the
veins of this clan. When the last MacNeill died, leaving no heir
in the direct line, the office and lands connected with Castle Sween
were given, in 1431, to the Earl of Argyll. Efric, his wife, here
laments the fact.</p>

<p>The other poetess is—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabel, Countess of Argyll.</span> In the Dean’s Book this lady
is described as “<span lang="gd">Isabella Ni vic Cailein</span>;” elsewhere she is called
“Contissa Ergadien.” She was Isabel Stewart, eldest daughter of
John, Lord of Lorn. She was married to Lord Colin Campbell,
who was created Earl of Argyll in 1457, and died in 1493. The
poems of these two ladies are interesting as showing that Gaelic
literature was cultivated in fashionable quarters at that period. I
have attempted a literal rendering in verse of the Countess’s
<span class="nowrap">poem:—</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In surveying the arena of history we observe places geographically
small sending forth the most prevailing of the forces that
have fashioned the course of civilisation. A glance at one or two
countries will readily illustrate the significance of the great factors
at work in the making of the world’s annals. We discern in Judea,
a small strip of land, the country whence the all-conquering
religion and civilisation of the whole earth have come; we find in
Greece—a small concatenation of tribes and provinces—a philosophic
and æsthetic power which has supplied the minds of men
with profound wisdom for centuries; for our laws and many of our
customs and institutions we are indebted to Rome, Pagan and
Christian—a city in a comparatively petty peninsula; in our own
isles of the Gentiles, not excluding Man, Ireland, and St. Kilda,
there has been developed the greatest moral force of the present,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
and it may be said of any millennium hitherto. Our British
islands look small indeed on the chart of the world; and it is
possible that our geographical insignificance may tempt everweening,
inimical powers, and some of our own subject nationalities, to
touch unkindly some day the mane of the British lion; but very
vainly indeed as long as Christian manliness resides in the hearts
of never-enslaved Britons.</p>

<p>Along the coasts of Britain lie several islets where were nursed
and whence have emanated national elements of moral power
which have to some extent influenced our all-prevailing Anglo-Celtic
empire. Lindisfarne, Inchcolm, and Iona we generally
know. Iona in Loch Erizort, Lewis, the interesting islets that stud
the west coast of the latter island, the far north tiny little Rona,
were in early days centres of light and religion, if not of culture.
To-day the tourist finds few or none to welcome him in many of
those once heaven-favoured island-homes that repose in their
attractive poetic solitude and antiquarian suggestiveness on the
majestic bosom of the Atlantic Ocean. But in the far-west St
Kilda there still resides as monarch, priest, and judge, that zealous
Free Church ordained missionary, Mr Mackay, who, according to
artist Sands’s admission, bravely wrestles with all the elements,
moral and physical, that conflict with the interests of man. But
leaving St. Kilda in its loneliness and sailing in among the inner
Hebridean Isles, we find in the fertile Island of Lismore—the
<em>great garden</em>—a man in the fifteenth century, often now referred
to in Gaelic literature, the Rev. Sir James Macgregor. A native
of Perthshire, belonging to a royal clan that was afterwards
“nameless by day,” with a heart filled with the enthusiasm and
perfervid spirit of his countrymen, he and his brother got up a
collection of the songs and ballads of their native land, which was
among the first of the <a id="tn-157">literary efforts</a> of the kind. In Lismore also
resided in later days another literary ecclesiastic, the sturdy MacNicol,
who produced an able volume of obstinate Scottish prejudice,
a pretty hearty, intelligent growl over the great lexicographer’s
“Journey to the Hebrides.”</p>

<p>To Macgregor’s book we are indebted for some specimens of
the poetry of his own and previous periods. Some of the votaries
of the muse to whom he assigned niches of honour in his collection
have been already referred to; the names of a few more, with a
few specimen verses of their compositions, are here given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Duncan Campbell</span> is described as “Duncan MacCailein,
the good knight.” He was Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
son of Sir Colin, who died in 1478. He must have been a knight
of some courtly and literary importance in his day, for he not only
wrote poetry in Gaelic, but he obtained from the powers that were
charters to extensive lands in Perthshire, and became one of the
Earls of Breadalbane. He is the author of several pieces of
poetry which have been characterised as remarkable for caustic
humour, indulged in sometimes at the expense of the female sex.
A published poem of his is a satirical elegy on a miser, a species
of beggar humanity that the world has not yet succeeded in extinguishing.
I give a literal metrical translation of some of the
<span class="nowrap">verses:—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duncan Macpherson</span> is thought to have been an ecclesiastic,
a class, notwithstanding Professor Blackie’s genial sneer about the
“solemn sepulchral piety of certain North-Western Gospellers,”

literary Highlander can refer to with national pride. The “sombre

<p>Many of the authors whose compositions appear in the Dean’s
Book were evidently professional men, either clerical or medical.
It was among these two classes that the lamp of literature was
kept burning. Many of the names are indeed suggestive of professional
connections, such as Mac-an-Olave, MacNab, Macpherson,
Maol Domhnuich, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It has been held that the Romish system of the celibacy of the
clergy was not introduced or acted upon till a century or two
before the Reformation. Whether or not this is true we have at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
all events quite a crop of clans whose progenitors must have been
the sons of ecclesiastical persons. We have Mac-an-Aba, MacNab,
from the son of the Abbot; MacVicar, from the son of the Vicar:
MacPherson, from the son of the Parson, or Persona; MacTaggart,
from the son of the Priest; MacMaster, from the son of the
Maighstir or Minister. Other names come to us through those
who devoted themselves to be the <em>servants</em> or <em>gillies</em> of God or of
some saints. Mac-gille-Chriost is Gilchrist, or the son of Gilchrist,
or the servant of Christ. Mac-gill’-Iosa, is Gillies, or the son of
the servant of Jesus; Mac-gill’-Iain, or MacLean, is the son of the
servant of Seathain, or John; Mac-gill’-Aindreais is the son of the
servant of Andrew; Mac-gill’-Eóra (Gill’-an-Leabhair) is the son
of the servant of the Book, Macindeor; Mac-gill’-Mhoire is
Morrison, the servant of Mary, &amp;c. The clerical element appears
to have been a powerful interest at one time in the Highlands and
Islands. Indeed, this may be said of Scotland as a whole, a
characteristic which has not yet become invisible. The Dean’s
book shows us the Highlands under the old order of things. A
vast change was impending. The Catholic ecclesiastical dispensation
was drawing to a close. The Church of Rome never gained
a powerful hold of the people; so in general they contemplated
its downfall with indifference. The intelligent of them who were
interested in religion had more sympathy with the old native
Church—the Celtic—which Rome supplanted or were ready to
embrace the new faith of awakening Christendom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillicalum Mac-an-Olave.</span>—This bard is the author of several
pieces of fair merit in the Dean’s Book. He appears to have been
one of the famous Beatons, <i lang="gd">Clann-an-Leigh</i>, of Islay, Mull, and
Skye. Of him and of several others in the Dean’s MS. we know
little more than their names, some of which I now give:—John of
Knoydart, who poetises on the murder of the young Lord of the
Isles by the Irish harper, Dermid O’Cairbre, at Inverness in 1490;
Duncan Mor, from Lennox; Gilchrist Taylor, Andrew Macintosh,
the Bard Macintyre, John MacEwen MacEachern, Duncan MacCabe,
Dougall MacGille Glas, Maol Domhnuich (Servus Domini),
Baron Ewen MacOmie, MacEachag, and Duncan, brother of the
Dean, Sir James Macgregor, who transcribed the most of the
manuscript so famous under his brother’s name.</p>

<p>There are a good few verses of a satiric character to be found
in the Dean’s collection. The reader is rather surprised to find
the religious Dean admitting such an estimate as the following of
monks and monasteries into his <span class="nowrap">collection:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I, Robert, went yesterday</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A monastery for to see;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to my wishing they said nay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because my wife was not with me!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Among the Irish pieces there are several satirical productions by
an Irish Earl Gerald, the fourth Earl of Desmond, directed against
the fair sex.</p>

<p>The ruthless and vindictive spirit which at this time prevailed
in Scotland may be gathered from the following verses of a battle-incitement
on the eve of the invasion of the English, which ended
on the fatal field of <span class="nowrap">Flodden:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Burn their women, lean and ugly!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Burn their children, great and small!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the hut and in the palace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Prince and peasant, burn them all!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plunge them in the swelling rivers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With their gear, and with their goods;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spare, while breath remains, no Saxon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Drown them in the roaring floods!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These lines have been translated by Professor Blackie, as well as
the next piece of banter.</p>

<p>Black John Macgregor of Glenstrae, who was buried at Dysart,
in Glenorchy, May 26, 1519, was a kind patron to the red-haired
bard Finlay MacNab, who begins his praises as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>One of the chief characteristics of the poetry of this period is
the clearness or distinctness of the ideas. The authors seize at
once their subject and straightway sing what they have to utter.
They also appear to have a definite object in view when they
invoke the muse, and they carry it out in a clear, direct, and unhesitating
fashion. The vagueness and mistiness of Macpherson’s
Ossianic poems have been much commented upon, and sometimes
with good reason. Nothing like mistiness can be affirmed of the
Ossianic poems which were composed or transcribed and were
popular at this period. The ideas of the authors stand out in
brilliant distinctness, like stars looking forth beneath the brows of
a frosty night.</p>

<p>The Lismore collection of songs and poems is not the only manuscript
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that received but
scant attention from our forefathers. Many ancient Gaelic manuscripts
carried by Christian missionaries to the Continent have never
returned. More than two hundred, once in the possession of Gaelic
scribes, may still be met with in the various European libraries.
Drs Laing and Skene, especially the latter, have done good service
to Scotland in this field. The admirable collection of Gaelic MSS.
in Edinburgh, some of which, it is hoped will yet be published, is
the result of the energetic efforts of Dr Skene. The Fernaig
manuscript which he has put in the hands of Professor Mackinnon,
contains according to the latter, some 4000 lines of Gaelic poetry
of the seventeenth century. It is hoped that Mr Mackinnon will
lend his ability and scholarship to the early publication of this
work. Judging by a published article of the Professor of Celtic in
Edinburgh, at the present date (November, 1889), he seems to be
unaware that the “Red Book” of Clanranald is not lost. He will
be glad to know that it is in the possession of Admiral Reginald
Macdonald. Mr Campbell of Islay, informed the writer once that
he and Mr <a id="err-164">O’Grady</a> had read the “Red Book.”</p>

<p class="p1">A retrospect of the remains of ancient Gaelic Literature
establishes the following among other facts:—1. That the Scottish
Gael of the first centuries of the Christian era was not a barbarian.
2. That a considerable body of oral or traditional literature was
then extant among the people. 3. That there is no evidence that
writing was known in the British Islands before the Christian era.
4. That relics of the writings of Churchmen from the fifth century
downwards still exist in manuscript. 5. That the literature of the
Irish and Scottish Gael, till the period of the Reformation in the
sixteenth century, had much in common, the language used in the
north-west of Ireland and in the north-west of Scotland being the
same.</p>

<p>We have come now to the consideration of the poetry which
may be regarded as <a id="tn-165">the beginnings of</a> modern bardic literature. It
shows a different spirit, while it is generally presented in a different
form. After Mary MacLeod, the chief productions of the Gaelic
muse from <i lang="gd">Iain Lom</i> to <i lang="gd">MacMhaighstir Alasdair</i> were Jacobite.</p>

<p>The persecutions and sufferings of the Clan-Gregor, “the clan
that was nameless by day,” form the theme of many interesting
and stirring ballads. The terrible valour, the undying courage,
and the heroic faithfulness of this much injured sept have been
beautifully drawn by Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>The authoress of Macgregor’s Lullaby was a daughter of Colin
Campbell of Glenorchy, and the wife of Gregor Macgregor, whose
death she laments in this Lullaby. Her husband, his brother,
Malcolm Roy, along with their father, Duncan Macgregor, were
beheaded in 1552 by Colin Campbell of Glenorchy, Campbell of
Glenlyon, and Menzies of Rannoch. The Black Duncan mentioned
in the song was her brother, the seventh laird of Glenorchy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
whose picture is still preserved at Taymouth Castle. The following
is Pattison’s rendering of the Lullaby, which, along with the
next two songs referred to (not in the Dean’s book), have always
been very <span class="nowrap">popular:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Early on a Lammas morning with my husband was I gay;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Other Macgregor Songs</em> of the same era are “<em>Macgregor O
Ruara</em>” and “<em>The Braes of the Ceathach</em>.” <em>Macgregor O Ruara</em>
begins <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There is sorrow, and sorrow, and sorrow now fills me—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Poor pitiful sorrow no man can redress;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is sorrow and sighing, and sadness that thrills me—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh! terrible sadness I cannot repress.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Macgregor has perished—Macgregor, pine-bannered—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Macgregor, beloved in Glenlyon the green;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Macgregor, the brave, by whose foes ever honoured</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The threatening roar of our pibroch has been.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Braes of the Mist” is one of the sweetest and most affecting
songs in any language. The singer—a woman—concealed her
husband and two sons of the fiercely persecuted Macgregors in a
bed as the enemies were approaching the house. She sat at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
fire and began singing her song. She sang of herself as waiting
in solitude for her persecuted friends. The people outside listened
as the woman sang, and accepting as true what she said, they
passed on without troubling her. Her heart’s dearest wishes depended
on the effect produced by her extempore verses. It has
been well said that “seldom, indeed, has song or ballad been
composed or chanted in circumstances of such intense excitement.”
The first verse runs as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I sit here alone, by the plain of the highway,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For my poor hunted kin, watching mist, watching by way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ve yet got no sign that they’re near to my dwelling;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At Loch Fyne they were last seen—if true be that telling, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i lang="gd">Mo Valie Veg Og</i> is a very popular song, somewhat like “Helen
or Kirkconnel Lea,” and Tennyson’s “Oriana.” The occasion of
the composition was as follows:—One of the chiefs of the Clan
Chisholm having carried off a daughter of Lord Lovat, placed her
on an islet in Loch Bruiach, where she was soon discovered by
the Frasers, who had mustered for the rescue. (Other accounts
of the origin of the song have been given). A severe
conflict ensued, during which the young lady was accidentally
slain by a chance blow from her own lover, in defending her from
her furious brothers. The lover was condemned to be executed
next day. The night preceding his execution he composed Mo
Valie Veg Og, <em>Young little May</em>. The following is a rendering of
the spirit of the <span class="nowrap">song:—</span></p>

<p><em>The Owlet.</em>—It is said that this poem was composed by a
Badenoch deer-stalker about 1550. It is two hundred and sixty-eight
lines in length. The “Owl” is the form of a dialogue
between the author and an owl, which, old and feeble, the unkind
hunter’s wife, who was much younger than he, brought in to be a
fit companion for her husband. There is a good deal of cleverness
and poetical ingenuity in the piece. It is the only composition of
the kind in the language, and reminds us of “Listen Little Porker,”
by the Welsh poet Merddyn Wyllt.</p>

<p><em>The Aged Bard’s Wish.</em>—This poem appeared towards the end
of last century, in the days of the Ossianic controversy, and has
come under the suspicions of the sceptical. It was then regarded
as an old poem, perhaps belonging to pre-Christian times. It
probably belongs to the first part of the seventeenth century. It
begins <span class="nowrap">thus—</span></p>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>

<p>There have been several translations of this much-admired poem,
but on account of occasional vagueness of conception and obscurity
of the style it has been found very difficult to convey with
certainty and accuracy the sense of the original. In one hundred
and forty-four lines the bard conjures up many scenes and images
before his mental vision, and finally welcomes the “Hall of Ossian
and Daol”—he cries, “Open, fly, the night comes, and the bard
is gone!”</p>

<p>Among the poetesses whose names have not been forgotten in
the story of Scottish letters is that of Mary Macleod, <i lang="gd">Mairi ni’n
Alastair Ruaidh</i>, or Mary, the daughter of red-haired Alexander.
Her name as a poetess has become quite proverbial among the
people. Apart from the mantle of poetry which she wore she was
a very remarkable person, who would be long remembered. Like
some others, her own assertive personality accounts for much of
the popularity of her productions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mairi ni’n Alastair Ruaidh</span>, who <a id="tn-169">has been regarded</a> by some
as the first in point of time of the modern Gaelic bards, was born
in Harris, in the Long Island, in 1569, and died at Dunvegan,
Isle of Skye, in 1674, at the extraordinary age of 105 years. She
received no education, yet her poetry is characterised by boldness,
freshness, and originality. The metres she uses are often complicated
and unusual; but the native melody of her song and the
pathetic character of her conceptions render her poetry very
enjoyable reading. She was a well-known visitor among her
neighbours, who generally rallied her by references to a beverage
stronger than water. Pattison translates a song she composed on
her being banished from Dunvegan by the young chief of the
MacLeods; who, on hearing her laudatory verses, sent a boat to
bring back the affectionate poetess.</p>

<i lang="gd">Iain Lom</i>, or <em>bare</em> John, was of the Keppoch family; lived in the
reigns of Charles I. and II.; was a very old man about 1710.</p>

<p>The heir of Keppoch was sent abroad to be educated; and in
his absence his affairs were entrusted to his cousins, who planned
a scheme to get rid of him so that they themselves would get
possession. The bard perceived their wicked scheme beforehand;
and comes prominently before us in his endeavours to expose
them; and again in the active part he took in punishing the
murderers. The massacre took place in 1663; and soon after the
poet persuaded Sir Alexander Macdonald to concert measures for
punishing the perpetrators of the deed. They were seized and
beheaded, and the awful retribution is commemorated by the ugly
monument, “<span lang="gd">Tobar nan Ceann</span>,” or “Well of the Heads,” in
Invergarry. Macdonald was politician as well as poet in his day.
He was a keen Jacobite, and acted as the laureate of the party in
the Highlands. He was the means of bringing the armies of
Montrose and Argyll together at Inverlochy, where, on Sunday,
February 2, 1645, a bloody battle was fought, in which the flower
of the Campbell clan were slain. He is a poet of great fire,
vigour, and satiric power. He was buried in Dunaingeal, in the
braes of Lochaber.</p>

<p>I have availed myself here of the rendering of Blackie, whose
literary deftness in translation and poetic genius have successfully
transferred not only the sense of, but frequently improved on, the
more artless of the productions of the Gaelic muse. If the versatile
Professor is not always boldly and simply literal in his
versions of Gaelic poetry, he never fails to seize and attractively
exhibit the spirit of the bard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archibald Macdonald.</span>—This minor bard, called “<span lang="gd">An Ciaran
Mabach</span>,” was a natural son of Sir Alexander Macdonald, 16th
baron of Sleat. He was contemporary with <i lang="gd">Iain Lom</i>. He was
a clever and highly practical man, and was entrusted in matters of
importance by his father, who allotted him a portion of land in
North Uist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neil Mackellar.</span>—-Mackellar was a farmer in Jura in 1694.
He does not appear to have composed much—a poetical address
of his to <i lang="gd">John Ruadh Mac Cailein</i>, the Earl of Argyll, which I
found among the papers of the poet Livingston, was published in
the fifth volume of the “<span class="smcap">Gael</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="gd">Diorbhail Nic-a’-Bhriuthain</span>, or Dorothy Brown, was a native
of Luing, an island in Argyllshire. She lived towards the close of
the seventeenth century, and, like many of the bards of the period,
was a keen Jacobite. Like <i lang="gd">Iain Lom</i>, she used her bitter satire
against the Clan Campbell with considerable effect. She is known
by her <i lang="gd">Oran do Alastair Mac Colla</i>, the famous Sir Alexander Macdonnell
of Antrim, and the gallant lieutenant of Montrose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="gd">Silis Ni’n Vic Raonaill</span>, or Cicely Macdonald, was the
daughter of Macdonald of Keppoch, and lived from the reign of
Charles II. to that of George I. Like Iain Lom and Dorothy
Brown, this poetess was a Roman Catholic, and her muse was
employed against the house of Hanover. Her husband having
died in a fit of intoxication while on a visit to Inverness, she composed
<i lang="gd">Marbhrann air bas a fir</i>, and afterwards some hymns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neil Mac Vurich</span>, who was born early in the seventeenth
century, was bard and senachie to the family of Clanranald. He
belonged to South Uist, where the land he had is still known as
<i lang="gd">Baile-bhaird</i>. He was a descendant of Muireadhach <em>Albannach</em>,
and grandfather of Lachlan Mac Vurich, whose name appears in
the Ossianic controversy. He wrote a Gaelic history of the Clan
Ranald, whose records he kept. He was living and an old man
in 1715.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Macdonald</span>, or <i lang="gd">Iain Dubh Mac Iain ’ic Ailein</i>, a gentleman
of the Clan Ranald family, was born in 1665. He held the
farm of Grulean in the island of Eigg. One of his best pieces is a
fiery martial poem called “<span lang="gd">Oran nam Fineachan Gaelach.</span>”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Aosdan Matheson</span>, who flourished in the seventeenth
century, belonged to Lochalsh, Ross-shire, where he had as his
bard free lands from the Earl of Seaforth. Much of his poetry,
like that of Neil Mac Vurich, has been lost. A poem, <i lang="gd">Do’n Iarla
Thuathach, Triath Chlann Choinnich</i>, has been freely rendered by
Sir Walter Scott: “Farewell to Mackenzie, high Chief of Kintail.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hector MacLean</span>, who lived in the seventeenth century, was
bard and senachie to Sir Lachlan MacLean of Duart. The Chief’s
<em>Elegy</em> is the subject of a <em>special</em> poem by the bard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lachlan MacKinnon</span>, who lived in the seventeenth century,
was a native of Strath, Isle of Skye. He was a bard of real power,
and a good many of his pieces have come down to us. Mackenzie,
collector of “The Beauties of Gaelic Poetry,” who delighted in
unearthing and publishing all the moral dirt he could lay his hands
on, relates a story about Mackinnon which does not represent the
bard’s character in a very attractive light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roderick Morrison.</span>—This famous bard, commonly called <i lang="gd">An
Clarsair Dall</i>, or the Blind Harper, was born in the island of
Lewis in 1646. He was a descendant of the <i lang="gd">Brieve Leosach</i>, well
known in the annals of the island. Roderick’s father was a man
of piety and culture, in Lewis, whose memory is still fragrant
among the people. It seems he was a true gospel light amid the
half-heathenism which then prevailed in the Western Isles. He
sent Rory and his other two sons to be educated at Inverness,
intending to educate the three sons for the church. In course of
time Angus settled in the parish of Contin, and Malcolm in
Poolewe, Ross-shire. Roderick lost his eyesight through the
small-pox when receiving his education in Inverness, and then
turned his attention to the study of music. He soon became
famous not only in Scotland, but also in Ireland. When returning
from the latter country it is said that he called at every baronial
residence on his way. Before going home to the north he visited
Edinburgh, where at the time the Scotch nobility and gentry were
met in Holyrood House. There he came across the chief, John
Breac MacLeod of Harris, by whom Roderick was at once engaged
as his family harper. While with MacLeod he composed
many tunes and songs which are yet popular. His patron MacLeod
afterwards gave him a rent-free farm at Totamor, in Glenelg.
After the death of John Breac he went back to his native Lewis,
where he was much respected in his old age. He died in this
island, and was buried in the churchyard of I or Hy, near Stornoway.
Morrison is a poet of considerable power and culture,
although his fame as a harper—he was almost the last of that class
so celebrated among the Gaels—has obscured his name as a poet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Mackay.</span>—This bard, known as <i lang="gd">Am Piobaire Dall</i>, or the
Blind Piper, whose father was of the Sutherlandshire Mackays, was
born in the parish of Gairloch, Ross-shire, in the year 1666.
Being born blind he was taught music, first by his father, afterwards
he was sent to the College of Pipers, in Skye, which was
then presided over by MacCruimein, of world-wide fame. In
course of time he became family bard to the chief of Gairloch.
While he stayed with this chief he is said to have composed
twenty-four <i lang="gd">piobrachds</i> and many strathspeys, reels, and jigs. He
died in 1754 at the great age of ninety-eight, and was buried in
Gairloch. The poems of this bard are thoughtful and well finished,
but, like many of that period, are scarcely known now.</p>

<p>The learned Edward Lhuyd published his “<span lang="la">Archæologia Britannica</span>”
in 1704; and the imaginative Celt of the day was delighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
that so much of the dying language of his forefathers would
be preserved—that so handsome a monument should be reared to
its memory. In 1707 a second edition was issued, in which complimentary
poetical addresses from Highland ministers were given.
There is one from the Rev. James MacPherson, Kildalton, Islay,
and another from the Rev. John Maclean of Killninian, Mull.
The following stanzas from Maclean’s verses are of considerable
merit in the original <span class="nowrap">Gaelic:—</span></p>

<p>Tyree, Mull, and Cowal are not the only places where clergymen
were wont to “woo the muse” in those days. Poetic expressions

<p>The Rev. Colin Campbell wrote his in Latin, which till that
period was the medium of communication among Highland
ecclesiastics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Whyte</span>, called <i lang="gd">Forsair Choir’an-t-Si</i>, belonged to the end
of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century. He
lived near Kilmun, and composed a good many songs which are
recognised as of a superior order. He was the ancestor of some
of the name who have been known for their strongly Celtic
sympathies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Mackenzie</span>, otherwise known as <i lang="gd">An Ceisteir Crubach</i>,
was born in Gairloch about 1670. He was a bard of superior
powers; but the loose character and profanity of some of his compositions
caused the Presbytery that engaged his services as a
Catechist to dismiss him from his office. Mackenzie, of “The
Beauties of Gaelic Poetry,” has published a lengthy song of his
which is a blot on the whole work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John MacLean</span>, who was a native of Mull, where he was for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
long a popular poet, is the author of a few songs of superior merit.
His compositions were general favourites at the time of Johnson
and Boswell’s journey to the Hebrides. They heard some of his
songs sung by a lady. He composed an excellent piece on Sir
Hector MacLean when he went to France in 1721. The bard
died in 1760.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malcolm MacLean</span>, otherwise known as <i lang="gd">Calum a’ Ghlinne</i>,
was a native of Kinlochewe, in Ross-shire. He was a soldier, and
served for some time abroad, where he deeply learned the worship
of Bacchus. “Mo Chailin donn og” is yet popular. It was composed
for his daughter. He died in 1764.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Am Bard Mucanach</span>, a Macdonald, originally from Glencoe,
lived in the island of Muck, and is the author of a very good poem
on the “Massacre of Glencoe.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angus Macdonald</span>, a native of Glencoe, is the author of the
popular song “<i lang="gd">Bha Claidheamh air Iain ’san t-searmoin</i>.” It was
intended to ridicule the cowardly conduct of a John Gibeach, who
was at the battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715, but who took to flight instead
of remaining to fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John MacCodrum.</span>—This original and witty bard was a native
of North Uist. He lived at the same time as his more famous
contemporary, Alexander Macdonald. The accomplished Sir
James Macdonald, who died at Rome in 1766, made MacCodrum
his bard, and gave him free land in North Uist. He met James
Macpherson when collecting Gaelic materials for the poems of
Ossian; and the Uist bard appears to have indulged in wit at the
expense of Macpherson. MacCodrum is a poet of great ability
and satiric power. His poems on “Old Age” and “Whisky”
are of a first-class order. He was, like many of the bards of his
day, a keen Jacobite.</p>

<p>The poet’s attachment to his patron inspired a tender elegiac
song of which the following translated verses are a <span class="nowrap">specimen:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent6">Our loving brothers:</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">O Christ! do Thou, &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The early death of the subject of this elegy,—of Sir James
Macdonald,—wrought the bard into unwonted seriousness. As
his name indicates, this poet is a representative of the commingled
Norse and Celtic races of the Hebridean people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hector MacLeod</span> was a native of South Uist. Like MacCodrum,
he was a zealous Jacobite, and after 1715 lived in the
Roman Catholic districts of Arisaig and Morar. There is much
originality and poetical ingenuity in MacLeod, who, finding it
dangerous to sing his Jacobite leanings without disguise, had recourse
to allegorical ways of expressing himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archibald Macdonald</span>, known as <i lang="gd">Gilleasbuig na Ciotaig</i>, or
left-handed Archibald, also a native of Uist, is one of the few
comic bards that the Highlands have produced. An “Elegy” on
John Roy, a piper while living, and the “Resurrection” of the
same, are really clever productions, as well as his song for Dr
MacLeod, a St. Kildian, who was for some time a surgeon in a
Highland regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zachary Macaulay</span>, whose father was an accomplished Episcopalian
clergyman, was born in the island of Lewis at the
beginning of the eighteenth century. He is thought in his youth
to have written some “wanton” songs; his published pieces show
true poetic instinct and power. The air of one of his songs was
a favourite with Burns. Lord Macaulay was a descendant of
Zachary’s family, from whom the brilliant essayist and historian
evidently inherited his genius.</p>

<p>Like that of all other peoples, the limited literature of the Scottish
Clans has had its periods of revival and decadence. The bolder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
and more original poetry of the early centuries of our story was
followed by the feeble and imitative strains of the verse writers of
the medieval generations.</p>


<h3>ALEXANDER MACDONALD.</h3>

<p>In the seventeenth century we had the silver age, and about the
middle of last century the golden age of modern Gaelic poetry.
Singers <a id="tn-179">of original power</a> appeared in every part of the country.
Of these Alexander Macdonald was the first and the greatest.
From the wilds of the Ardnamurchan regions he poured forth his
imperishable strains. After him Duncan Macintyre comes next,
the poet-hunter of Glenorchay. From the heart of central
Argyll and Breadalbane he sent forth unique and inimitable songs.
In the grand wilds of Perthshire Dugald Buchanan, the sacred
bard of Rannoch, was writing his sublime poems on such awful
themes as the “Judgement” and the “Passion” of the God-man.
In the far North Robert Mackay, the famous Sutherlandshire
herd, was gladdening the firesides, of a happy peasantry—whose
descendants are now in Canada—with his witty and satiric compositions.
In the West the delicate and fine-fibred William Ross
began to sing soon after these, his sweet lays of love and sorrow.
Jacobite rebellions no doubt stirred up the Highland heart at this
period; and in the midst of the political ferment of the times the
muse appears to have thrown her choicest mantle on receptive
spirits among the people to give song-utterance to their emotional
aspirations. In the poetry of Macdonald, Mackay, and Macintyre,
we see the greatest bards of modern times. It is difficult to decide
which of the first and last mentioned is the greater poet—Mackay
is not regarded as equal to either. As far as the works
of preceding bards could help their poetic culture their minds
were moulded by the same influences.</p>

<p>But in regard to ordinary education it must be remembered that
Macdonald was for some time at a University, while Macintyre
was never able to write. In their descriptions of outward nature
their poetry shows very much like equal power, while the note of
the one is not always distinguishable from that of the other. But
the passionate depth of the one has no echo in the sweeter and
gentler nature of the other. Each in his own way is a mighty
singer of whom any country might be proud. And it is remarkable
that both should be Argyllshire singers.</p>

<p>Alexander Macdonald, also more frequently called <i lang="gd">Mac-Mhaighstir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Alastair</i>, son of Master Alexander, was born early in the
eighteenth century, the exact date and place of his birth being
nowhere recorded. His father, Mr Alexander, as he was always
styled by the Highlanders, was an Episcopalian clergyman. He
resided at Dailea, in Moydart, and is said to have united farming
with his ecclesiastical functions. He had several <a id="tn-180">sons and daughters</a>,
and Alexander was his second son. Alexander received his education
first under the superintendence of his father, and afterwards
for a session or two in the University of Glasgow. His academic
career was cut off early by an imprudent marriage. It is not
known with certainty whether it was for the Church or for the Bar
he was originally intended. It was feared that his general character
and conduct would scarcely warrant entrance into the former;
while his wild changeableness and irregularities would seriously
bar his progress for the latter. He ultimately settled in Ardnamurchan,
teaching, farming, and writing poetry. He then changed
his ecclesiastical creed, became a Presbyterian and an elder in the
Established Church, which he continued to be till the year 1745,
when again he changed his creed, became a Roman Catholic, and
forsook his all to join Prince Charles. He held a commission in
the Highland Army, which he tried to animate by his fiery and
warlike songs. For some time after the battle of Culloden he
suffered much hardship. One night, while lurking outside somewhere,
so intense was the cold that the side of Macdonald’s head,
which rested on the ground, was grey when he rose in the morning.
Soon after friends in Edinburgh procured teaching for the bard
among Jacobite families. But he did not stay long there. He
returned to the Highlands, where he died when he had reached a
good old age. His life was stormy and checkered, like the historic
period which was then also coming to a close.</p>

<p>Macdonald’s first literary work was a Gaelic and English Vocabulary,
published in 1741. It was the first attempt of the kind.
His poetry was first published in Edinburgh in 1761, and his
volume was the first book of original poems ever published in
Gaelic. He wrote extensively, but two thirds of his works in MSS.
have been lost or destroyed. As we read the works of Macdonald
and those of Macpherson’s Ossian—the two highest names in
Gaelic poetry—we feel at once that we breathe the air of different
regions, or move in the atmosphere of different ages. Between
them and the common herd of bards we discern a vast interval in
the range of their poetical conceptions. Both breathe the spirit
of “<span lang="gd">Tir nam beann, nan gleann, ’s nan gaisgeach</span>,” but their deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
utterances of the soul from the mystic land of fancy and passion
are not alike. The inspiration of both is that of the great Bens,
the mysterious-seeming valleys, and of deep crying unto deep.
Macdonald is wild, picturesque, and gorgeous, ever presenting the
dread and sad realities of nature. He loves to picture her coarser
characteristics more than her qualities of tenderness. His poetry
glows with sensuous imagery, overflows with luxuriance of thought
and voluptuousness of feeling, and exhibits much of the animal
and material elements of creation. His music is wild, impetuous,
and fiery; his metres sometimes smooth, and ruggedly rushing.
In accomplishing his more elaborate efforts he shows signs of
spasmodic tendencies. He excels in intensity of thought and in
fiery vehemence of expression. The force of poetical ardour with
which he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurls the Birlin through the cold glens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Loudly snoring,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is deeply absorbing. Natural scenes in the West Highlands he
describes with vigour and striking effect. Sometimes he becomes
quite majestic, as when he sings of “rain-charged clouds on thick
squalls wandering loomed and towered.” Some of the parts of
his principal poem, <i>The Birlin</i>, a boat voyage in the Hebrides,
are very powerful and sometimes sublime. The unrestrained
vehemence and gorgeousness of <i>The Birlin</i> give place to simpler
delineations in <i>The Sugar Brook</i>. There is much delicious portraiture
in this last poem.</p>

<p><i>The Praise of the Lion</i> is a fiery appeal to the Scottish nationality.
The Jacobite cause is the theme of many of his songs, Prince
Charles being sometimes personified under female names, such as
“Morag.” In his love songs Macdonald is sweet, tender, and
musical, rough though his muse is at other times. His “Praise
of Morag,” in a sort of <i lang="gd">piobrachd</i> measure, is powerful; but composed
under such conditions as Burns wrote “Mary in Heaven,”
Macdonald’s lawful spouse became alarmed and jealous. At once
he turns to “Dispraising Morag,” which he works out elaborately
with Mephistophelian ardour and spirit, regardless of all poetic
justice and decency. “The Resurrection of the Gaelic Tongue”
is a powerful poem, celebrating the antiquity and supreme excellence
of the language of the Gael.</p>

<p>As specimens of the sweet and tender in Macdonald’s poetry,
let us take a verse or two from his fine piece, <i>The Sugar Brook</i>.
He has done for <a id="tn-181">this insignificant</a> burn what Burns has done for
the Doon and Gray for the Luggie. He describes the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
birds tuning their little throats in the morning to take up the
several parts assigned to them in the great harmonic chorus of
nature. He hears the rich treble of Robin, the deep bass of
Richard, the “goo-goo” of the cuckoo; while on a stake apart
from the rest the thrush sings lustily, and the blythesome brown
wren and the vieing linnet tune up their choicest strings. The
blackcock croaks, and the hen sings her hoarse response. Then
come the fishes, the bees, and the frisking calves, the milkmaid
and the herdsman, to fill up a scene already sufficiently gorgeous.

Gaelic poetry, and presents peculiar difficulties to the translator.

<p>In this spirit the poem extends to more than 500 lines, divided
into 16 parts, until finally the voyage of the Birlin ends somewhat
like that of St. Paul.</p>

<p>Till within recent years the practice of walking cloth in peasant
homes was a general thing. The writer has often witnessed it in
the north as well as in the south Highlands, in places where walking
mills did not extinguish the ancient ways of Highland women.
The “<span class="smcap">Morag</span>” of Macdonald was a “Walking Refrain,” or song
for a young woman of fair bewitching tresses. In history her <em>alias</em>
is Prince Charlie whose adventures touched the hearts of women,
bards and weak-minded statesmen. “<span lang="gd">Ho Morag</span>” in other words
is a treasonable prayer, adoration, or incitement for Jacobitically-minded
Highlanders and others. The bard’s heart was evidently
in this wretched and ill-starred rebellion; but it ought not to be
forgotten that if the poet’s heart tended to disloyalty he had
thousands of titled traitors and sympathisers close to the Hanoverian
throne. The Jacobite bard rushes with inexhaustible
enthusiasm into the “walking” labours of the Highland women
as their thoughts travel after the fair adventurer:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Further on the bard is “enthused” over the deeds of Montrose

Antrim, whose heroism has not yet received its due reward:</p>

<span class="fs70">MACPHERSON’S OSSIAN.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That is what I always maintained. He has found names, and stories,
and phrases, nay passages in old songs, and with them has blended his own
compositions, and so made what he gives to the world as the translation of
an ancient poem.”—<span class="smcap">Samuel Johnson.</span></p>
</div>


<p>Few questions have more deeply disturbed the equanimity of the
literary world than the age and authorship of the “Poems of
Ossian.” The national antagonism and prejudices of three kingdoms
were roused over the name of the poor old bard, when his
reputed works first appeared nearly one hundred and thirty years
ago. A controversy of exceeding keenness ensued; it has not
ended yet; and we may well question whether it will ever be satisfactorily
settled. It is proposed here to give the history of the
poems and annex the opinions of all those entitled to be heard on
the question of authorship.</p>


<h3>THE OSSIANIC QUESTION.</h3>

<p>1. <em>Sketch of the “Poems of Ossian.</em>”—In the year 1759 James
Macpherson was tutor in the family of Graham of Balgowan, at
Moffat. There he met John Home, the author of “Douglas.”
Home was told by Professor Adam Fergusson, a Gaelic-speaking
Highlander, that some remains of ancient Gaelic poetry existed;
and getting translations of specimens from Macpherson, a native
of Badenoch, he showed them to Drs Blair, Fergusson, and
Robertson, by whom they were highly appreciated. Importuned
by them, he translated all he had, and published in 1760 “Fragments
of Ancient Poetry Collected in the Highlands of Scotland.”</p>

<p>The friends already mentioned wished to secure all other relics
that could be found in the Highlands; and the tutor, then a
divinity student, was provided with funds, and undertook his
famous journey through the Highlands, where he received MSS.,
and took down poetry from the recitation of old people. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
first accompanied by Lachlan Macpherson of Strathmashie, a
gentleman and a scholar, and also a bard himself, for some time
on his tour; he was also joined latterly by Captain Alexander
Morrison, who subsequently assisted him. He returned to Badenoch,
and remained there till January, 1761, preparing his materials
for the next publication, assisted by Macpherson and Morrison.
Two Perthshire clergymen were also near him—the Revs. Mr Gallie
and James MacLagan, the latter no mean poet himself. By these
also he was assisted, and he kept correspondence with them.</p>

<p>In 1762 appeared in London, “Fingal,” an epic in six books,
along with other sixteen poems.</p>

<p>Next year appeared “Temora,” in eight books, and five other
poems. “A specimen of the original of ‘Temora,’” the seventh
book in Gaelic, was also published in this volume.</p>

<p>These <em>epics</em> kindled scepticism in many minds; and the “translator,”
smarting under imputations of forgery, as well as filled
with vanity at being thought the author of the poems, indulged
himself in sullen silence.</p>

<p>2. <em>Dr Johnson.</em>—The great king who reigned in literary matters
in those days was Samuel Johnson, a very worthy man, but full of
obstinate prejudices against everything Scotch and Highland. He
undertook a journey to the Hebrides purposely to investigate into
the Ossianic question; but he came with the absolute belief that
Gaelic was never written, and no poems of any consequence existed
in that language. Boswell’s journal:—“Dr Johnson proceeded—‘I
look upon Macpherson’s “Fingal” to be as gross an
imposition as ever the world was troubled with. Had it been
really an ancient work ... it would be a curiosity of the first
<span class="nowrap">rate.’...</span></p>

<p>“When Dr Johnson came down, I told him ... that Mr
MacQueen repeated a passage in the original Erse, which Mr
Macpherson’s translation was pretty like; and reminded him that
he himself once said he did not require Mr Macpherson’s ‘Ossian’
to be more like the original than Pope’s ‘Homer.’</p>

<p>“Johnson—‘Well, sir, that is just what I always maintained.
He has found names, and stories, and phrases, nay, passages in
old songs, and with them has blended his own compositions, and
so made what he gives to the world as the translation of an ancient
poem.’ So also thought Laing in his famous and elaborate essay;
as well as thousands of others who accepted the dicta of these
writers.”</p>

<p>3. <em>The Highland Society’s Report</em>, got up with great candour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
and after much inquiry and research, and with the testimonies of
noblemen, gentlemen, and clergymen, bearing on the question,
from all parts of the Highlands, appeared in 1806. It was prepared
by Henry Mackenzie, the author of “The Man of Feeling.”
The result arrived at was:—</p>

<p>1st, That the characters of Macpherson’s poem were not invented,
but were subjects of Highland tradition; and that poems
certainly existed which might be called Ossianic.</p>

<p>2d, That such poems had been handed down from an unknown
period by oral recitation, and that many Highlanders could still
repeat them.</p>

<p>3d, That such poems had been written, and some were to be
found in MSS.</p>

<p>4th, That Macpherson used many such poems in his work by
joining separated pieces together, and that, by adding connective
narratives of his own, he had woven them into larger poems and
the so-called epics. No materials were found, however, to show
the extent of this process and the amount of genuine matter the
poems as published by Macpherson contained.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Gaelic Ossian</em> was published in 1807, accompanied with
Macfarlane’s Latin version and Mac Arthur’s dissertation. It came
through the hands of Macphersons’s executors, assisted by Dr
Thomas Ross, of Lochbroom. Money was collected in the East
Indies by military gentlemen to defray the expense of publication,
and before Macpherson died in 1796 he had the copy ready for
the press; but no traces were to be found of any ancient MSS.
which he might have used in preparing his copy, if he ever had
any such MSS. that he used. There is nothing exceptionally
ancient about the text of 1807.</p>

<p>5. <em>New State of the Question.</em>—Highlanders, with very few exceptions,
if any, on its appearance accepted the Gaelic text of
1807 as the genuine originals from which Macpherson translated,
and which they regarded as composed by Ossian in the third
century. But the views of Johnson and Laing were still subscribed
to by the great majority of English-speaking people.</p>

<p>6. <em>Macgregor’s “Genuine Remains.”</em>—Patrick Macgregor, M.A.,
barrister, published in 1841 the genuine remains of “Ossian” in
an English rhythmical translation not much inferior to Dr Clerk’s
with a very well-written historical introduction maintaining the
authenticity of the Gaelic Ossian.</p>

<p>7. <em>Irish Writers</em> were all along jealous of the attention which
Macpherson’s translations secured for Gaelic poetry in Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Societies and individuals determined not to be behind Scotland in
supplying the public with ancient Ossianic poems. The <em>Ossianic
Society</em> especially published five volumes of tales, and poems, and
translations; Macpherson was charged with stealing the substance
of his poems from Ireland; and at the same time the arguments
of Johnson and Laing were reiterated; while the most of what
they themselves published as ancient was not more than a century
or two old. The Irish could neither manufacture nor lay their
hands on epics like those of James Macpherson, so Dr Drummond,
Edward O’Reilly, &amp;c., charged Macpherson with <em>fabricating</em> the
poems, when they found they could not prove that he stole them
from Ireland. Ireland has extensive Celtic literature; much of
it ancient too; but it can show nothing like Macpherson’s productions.</p>

<p>8. <em>Dr W. F. Skene.</em>—This Celtic scholar says:—“A review
of all the circumstances which have been allowed to transpire regarding
the proceedings of James Macpherson seems rather to lead
to the conclusion that the Gaelic version, in the shape in which it
was afterwards published, had been prepared in Badenoch, during
the months Macpherson passed there, after his return from his
Highland tour, with the assistance of Lachlan Macpherson of
Strathmashie, and Captain Morrison, and that the English translation
was made from it by Macpherson in the same manner in
which he had translated the fragments.” The following facts
appear to favour Dr Skene’s conclusion:—After Lachlan Macpherson’s
death, a paper was found in his repositories containing
the Gaelic of the seventh book of Temora, in his handwriting, with
many corrections and alterations, and thus described—“First rude
draft of the seventh book of Temora.”</p>

<p>Mr Gallie sent to the Highland Society a part of the Gaelic of
Fingal, which afterwards appeared as part of the Gaelic version.
He had taken it from a MS. he had recovered, written by a friend,
“who was at that time with Mr Macpherson and me—a gentleman
well known for an uncommon acquaintance with the Gaelic, and a
happy facility in writing it in Roman characters.” Pressed to tell
who this friend was, he says:—“His name was Lachlan Macpherson,
of Strathmashy. He died in 1767.” Dr Skene says:—“This
Gaelic version seems, therefore, to have been put together
before 1767; and if before 1762, it will account for the original of
the seventh book of Temora having been published in that year,
and also for an advertisement which appeared soon after the publication
of the second quarto, that the originals were lying at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
publisher’s, and would be published if a sufficient number of subscribers
came forward; but as few subscribers appeared, and fewer
came to look at them, they were withdrawn.”</p>

<p>The view of Dr Skene was scarcely maintained hitherto by any
Scottish Gaelic scholar. Shaw in 1788 echoed Johnson’s sentiments.
He began to read through Macpherson; and was held
immediately to scorn by the Gaelic literati.</p>

<p>9. <em>The Late Rev. Thomas Pattison</em>, author of “The Gaelic
Bards” (1866), and a man highly capable of forming judgment on
the question, says, “When we consider that the finest parts of
Macpherson’s Ossian are incontestably proved to have been
popular poetry long anterior to his appearing, I think we should
throw all prejudice aside, and affirm that whoever composed the
poems attributed to Ossian, James Macpherson was not the man;
and that whatever merit may belong to him as a translator, or
whatever claim he may have to be considered their compiler in
their present form, he has no legitimate title to be called their
author. They are substantially older than he, probably by many
centuries.” Pattison, like many others before him, dwells on
Macpherson’s inferior Gaelic scholarship; but the facts do not
warrant the conclusion drawn, that Macpherson was incapable of
writing the Gaelic Ossian. Macpherson was a man of genius, and
quite able to deliver himself in Gaelic as good and classical as many
scholars that lived then or since.</p>

<p>10. <em>John F. Campbell, Esq.</em>—The most formidable opponent of
the authenticity of Macpherson’s Ossian recently is Mr Campbell
of Islay. His earlier views, as expressed in the Highland Tales,
were those of Gaelic-speaking Highlanders in general. But the
longer he dwelt among the genuine old ballads found in manuscripts
and in collections taken down from the oral recitation of
Highlanders who lived before Macpherson’s time, the more confirmed
he became in his growing conviction that Macpherson was
both translator and author, and that the English was first composed.
“My opinion now,” he says, “is that Macpherson’s translation
was first composed by a great genius, partly from a knowledge of
Scotch nature and folk-lore, partly from ideas gathered from books,
and that he and other translators afterwards worked at it, and
made a Gaelic equivalent whose merit varies according to the
translator’s skill and knowledge of Gaelic. It is said that an early
copy of the 7th book of Temora, with corrections in Strathmashie’s
hand, was found after his death. I suppose that he revised a
Gaelic translation by Macpherson, or by some other. His own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Gaelic songs are idiomatic, whereas the 7th book of Temora is
Saxon Gaelic in general, and nonsense in many passages. The
English equivalent is like the rest of Macpherson’s work. In
either case, because of matter, manner, orthography, and language,
Macpherson’s English and Gaelic Ossian, must have been composed
long after Dean MacGregor collected his book in Macpherson’s
country, near his district, and in Morven.” This is the opinion of
a Gaelic-speaking gentleman thoroughly conversant with the facts
of the case, and eminently qualified to maintain his side of the
question.</p>

<p>11. <em>Mr Hector MacLean</em>, Mr Campbell’s clever co-adjutor in
much of his work, takes a similar view. He says—“The so-called
Gaelic Ossian of Macpherson exhibits all the symptoms of
being a translation from English. Anglicisms abound everywhere;
the structure of the verse is fully as much akin to English as to
Gaelic poetry. It is deficient in all the good qualities of style,
strength, clearness, and propriety. The versification is exceedingly
rugged and irregular; alliteration, so characteristic of Celtic
poetry, is generally deficient, and frequently entirely wanting; the
sentiment is usually morbid and vapid; and in fact the so-called
original Gaelic Ossian is almost in every respect inferior to the so-called
English translation.” MacLean at the same time speaks
of the ballads in Campbell’s <i lang="gd">Leabhar na Féinne</i> as “characterised
by purity of language, vigour of expression, and smoothness of
versification.” MacLean’s thorough knowledge of Gaelic as well
as his English culture and philological attainments entitle him to
be heard.</p>

<p>12. <em>Rev. Dr Archibald Clerk.</em>—The dissertation prefixed to the
magnificent edition of Ossian, Gaelic and English, published in
1871, at the expense of the Marquis of Bute, and edited with a
new literal translation into English by Dr Clerk, of Kilmallie,
should be read by all who wish to know the history of the Ossianic
controversy. Dr Clerk was an accomplished Gaelic scholar—a man
of culture and sound judgment. He ably and warmly maintains
that Macpherson was only a translator. In him his opponents
find a writer thoroughly qualified, by his literary, scholarly, and
philological attainments, to deal with this vexed question. When
he and Mr Campbell fail to agree, it is very difficult for others
less conversant with the facts of the case to arrive at any satisfactory
conclusion. While Dr Clerk was patriotically engaged on
his splendid new edition of Ossian, Mr Hector MacLean was
regretting “that those who know Gaelic as their vernacular should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
be so far duped as to spend their time translating into English
what is really nothing else than an inferior and incorrect translation
from that language.”</p>

<p>13. <em>The Rev. Dr Hately Waddell.</em>—“Ossian and the Clyde”
is the title of a large, and elaborate, and ingenious work by Dr
Waddell. He holds that “Ossian” is historical and authentic;
and he supports this position by a three-fold argument—geological,
geographical and etymological, and traditional. The work is
learned and eloquent; and the author pursues his argument with
much minuteness and research. He believes in Ossian by instinct,
just as many of his opponents have rejected the same by instinct.
He holds that Macpherson is merely editor and translator; and
that he has used no liberties with his text beyond what an editor
and translator is entitled to use. He, however, labours under the
disadvantage of not knowing the Gaelic language, although this
difficulty is much minimised by the help of Dr Clerk’s literal translation
and notes. Part of his arguments is certainly new and
original; and the book deserves perusal on the part of the student
of the Ossianic controversy.</p>

<p>14. <em>Dr August Ebrard.</em>—This distinguished German divine and
writer, whom Professor Blackie describes as an “impartial spectator”
and a “well-trained German scholar,” has written an article
on this question in which, after giving a historical sketch, he indicates
his arguments in favour of the authenticity of Macpherson’s
Ossian. He says, “in Ossian’s poems there is presented to us the
subject-matter of Observations and thoughts, just such as would
have occurred to the remembrance of one who had taken part in
these battles. And whoever may have cast this material into its
present form it is certain that he has left the substance thus unaltered.
And why should this not actually have proceeded from
this Ossian—prince, warrior, and poet? We know that in old
times it was the common custom of the Celtic tribes that the bards
should accompany the army to battle, and that every warlike and
heroic deed should straightway be celebrated in more or less detailed
song. Undoubtedly this would happen with the numerous
warlike deeds of King Finnghal. How intelligible it must, then,
appear, that after the death of Finnghal and the ruin of his kingdom,
the king’s son, Ossian, who had fled to the Hebrides, and
who was now a blind old man, should have collected into such
<a id="tn-191">complex epics</a> as “Carthonn,” “Finnghal,” and “Timora,” the
songs which had been sung, partly by himself and partly by friendly
bards (as Carul and Ulin). How intelligible that these poems,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
noble in themselves, as well as being reminiscences of <a id="tn-192">former
magnificence</a>, should have been preserved with a fond tenacity,
and transmitted from generation to generation in the usual manner,
by learning by heart, in the centuries (300-900) when the Caledonian
nation was so heavily oppressed by the Nordmen, Picts,
Britons, and Anglo-Saxons.” He further says:—“And thus all
the linguistic phenomena are forthwith explained.” Dr Ebrard is
well known as the author of a work on the early Celtic Church,
and by his Gaelic grammar.</p>

<p>15. <em>Professor John Stuart Blackie.</em>—In presenting the views of
those entitled to be heard on this question it only remains now to
give the conclusions arrived at by Professor Blackie, who is
acquainted with Gaelic and thoroughly familiar with all the facts.
He holds that the question has never yet been examined in a
strictly philological fashion. After going through the whole of the
originals recently he holds, in opposition to Mr Campbell, that the
Gaelic is unquestionably the original. He brings forward five
tests by which a translator’s hand is clearly discoverable:—</p>

<p>(1.) In the English version, awkward, forced, and unidiomatic
expressions frequently occur, which can be clearly traced to the
influence of a Gaelic original.</p>

<p>(2.) In all poems of any antiquity handed down in manuscripts
difficulties will occur, arising from obsolete words, errors in transcription,
confused connection, and other causes. In such cases
it is a common practice with translators to skip the difficulty, gloss
over the matter with some decent commonplace, and sometimes
to make positive blunders, which it is not difficult for a philologer
to expose. All these signs of a translator’s hand are frequent in
Macpherson’s English, and would be more so had he not indulged
in such a habit of skipping generally, that it is difficult to say in
certain cases decidedly that the skip was made because the writer
of the English wished to shirk a difficulty.</p>

<p>(3.) It is a common practice with translators, when they find a
passage a little obscure, to remove the obscurity by some manifest
alteration of the phrase, or even by interpolating a line or interlarding
a commentary. This also occurs in Macpherson.</p>

<p>(4.) It is not always that a translator writes under the same
vivid vision, or the same fervid inspiration as the original poet.
The instance of failure to seize the most striking features of the
original, and the substitution of generic for specific epithets are
frequent in Macpherson.</p>

<p>(5.) Most translators yield—sometimes, no doubt, wisely—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
the temptation of improving on their originals, and Macpherson,
from what we know of him, was the last man in the world to think
of resisting such a temptation. How much of the Gaelic as we
now have it—that is, his clean copy of his own originals—was subjected
to this process of beautification no one can tell, but departures
from the simplicity of the original can be traced in several
instances.</p>

<p>He thinks that the English, as a whole, is a translation from the
Gaelic, and not a translation of the best quality in many respects,
and that this may be accepted as one of the best ascertained facts
in the range of philological investigation. Philological induction,
combined with the amount of external evidence to be found in the
Highland Society’s report, produce a cumulative proof which he is
most anxious to see how Mr Campbell can rebut. Principal
Shairp thinks that Professor Blackie has hit upon the true solution
of this controversy.</p>

<p>16. <em>Mr Archibald MacNeill, W.S.</em>, with his brothers Lord
Colonsay and Sir John MacNeill, who were all familiar with the
Gaelic language, firmly believed that the Gaelic text of Macpherson
belonged to the early centuries of the Christian era. Mr
MacNeill published his views in a small volume in which legal
acumen is brought to bear on the question, and which concludes
as follows: “At what date Ossian lived we do not pretend to
determine; but this, at least, is sufficiently clear, that the Gaelic
Ossian was not the production of Macpherson or any author of
modern times, but must be referred to a period of remote antiquity.
It further appears from the internal evidence of these poems, that
they refer to a period prior to the diffusion of Christianity and the
era of clanship.” Of course Macpherson was clever enough,
granting he elected to do so, to give a complexion of antiquity to
his compositions.</p>

<p>17. My own opinion of the question I embody in the following
propositions. I began the study of Macpherson’s Ossian some
twelve years ago, and exercised myself then in translating many
portions of it, so I am fairly familiar with it.</p>

<p>I believe—</p>

<p>(1.) That the English is a translation from Gaelic, probably
from a ruder version than that published in 1807.</p>

<p>(2.) That Macpherson is neither absolutely the author, nor
merely the translator, of the poems connected with his name.</p>

<p>(3.) That he formed his original Gaelic by joining and recasting
old ballads, that he connected these ballads by paragraphs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
of his own composition, and that the newly-written recast matter
constitutes the chief parts of the epics which he had thus formed,
but in which, however, the spirit of the old productions still
survives.</p>

<p>(4.) That the Gaelic is far more elaborate than the English, is
subtler in conception, less concrete in expression, and has been
likely, before the text was finally published, the subject of many
alterations and improvements.</p>

<p>(5.) That on the whole the language of the text of 1807 is not,
as some allege, essentially different from that of the ballads that
are known to be genuine.</p>

<p>(6.) That the metre of the Gaelic text is not more irregular
than that of these same ballads, the chief difference being that
while the latter are mostly made up of either trochees or iambs
the former frequently mixes anapaests with trochees or iambs.</p>

<p>The Highland Society’s report, in a general way points to similar
conclusions. The process adopted by Macpherson was early
described by Dr Smith (1780) who is supposed to have dealt with
ballads in Macphersonic fashion:—“Mr Macpherson compiled
his publication from those parts of the Highland songs which he
most approved, combining them into such forms as, according to
his ideas, were most excellent, retaining the old names and leading
events.” This is what Dr Smith himself honestly did in his <i lang="gd">Sean
Dana</i>; and it is rather surprising, after Dr Smith’s description of
the process adopted by himself, and probably also by Macpherson,
that any intelligent persons, whether Highland or otherwise,
should insist on the absolute originality of every line in the texts
of both Smith and Macpherson. I believe no conscientious dishonesty
was intended by either, especially by Smith. They were
both influenced by the loose views of editorial functions prevalent
in their day. The question of what was Macpherson’s ideal of
editorial functions lay ignored all along at the root of the Ossianic
controversy. A seriously mistaken and uncritical view it was; but
he thought he was doing what would be for the credit of his native
country.</p>

<p>When the writer arrived at the conclusions just indicated, ten
years ago, he was not so clear as to the process by which Macpherson
wrought the Gaelic and English Ossians into their present
forms. Since then, in 1883, he entered more minutely into the
question in a paper read before <a id="tn-194">the Gaelic Society</a> of London
and the conclusion forced upon his mind, as the result chiefly of
comparisons between the various versions of the Gaelic fragments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
which were found in mysterious circulation in Macpherson’s lifetime,
was that the Gaelic Ossian, like the English equivalent, was
a production of the last century, and that James Macpherson was
the author as well as translator of these celebrated compositions of
the Gaelic muse. Dr Macdonald, M.P., President of the Gaelic
Society, and other expert Gaelic scholars present, while reluctant
to accept the conclusions of the paper, did not seriously attempt
to dispute them; while Mr Macdonald Cameron, M.P., regarded
the arguments brought forward as clearly decisive on the question.
Since then Mr Macbain of Inverness ably discussed the poems
from other standpoints, and has informed the writer that the
late Dr Cameron of Brodick adopted similar views. The great
Ossianic question may now be regarded as settled. What was
needed all along to settle it was sufficient knowledge, culture,
judgment, and honesty on the part of men familiar with the Gaelic
language. Such men have appeared since the publication of Dr
Clerk’s Ossian, the first note being sounded by Mr J. F. Campbell
in his celebrated review of Clerk’s work in <cite>The Times</cite>. Mr H.
Maclean adopted the same views; and the writer, in 1883, on
independent and other grounds was forced to take up the same
position. Dr Cameron and Mr Macbain, representing the midland
and northern Highlands, having now concurred, the students
of the Gaelic language north and south unite thus in regarding
Macpherson’s Gaelic Ossian as compositions of the last century.
These compositions are great original works, and ought to be thus
described. Their spirit is ancient and Celtic, though their form
is modern. They, James Macpherson their author, and Gaelic
literature stand in the same relation to one another that we find
illustrated in the case of the “Idyls of the King,” Alfred Tennyson,
and Cymric literature. The only difference is that Tennyson
has not given us the “Idyls” in Welsh as well as in English, and
that Macpherson’s English version is in prose instead of being in
blank verse. As long as Gaelic scholars of undoubted respectability
believed otherwise, it was difficult for outsiders like the Blackies,
Ebrards, and Waddells, who discussed the question, to be certain
of their conclusions; but henceforth it will be inexcusable in any
man of letters to argue for the old views, as Mr George Eyre-Todd
does in an introduction to the “Poems of Ossian,” published in
the <cite>Canterbury Poets</cite> series (1888) without taking any cognisance
of the latest deliverances of those most entitled to express an
opinion.</p>

<p>For a long time the controversy regarding the poems of Ossian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
had only the English version for its critical basis; so it was unreasonable
then to expect a satisfactory solution of the vexed
question of authorship. Those who knew the language could only
guess at the originals; and those who did not know it had to be
satisfied with all they could make of the English. Both parties
occupied a position critically absurd. The one side ignorant of
the language could not presume to pronounce whether the poems
were or were not a translation; and the other had not yet the
materials for judgment before them. But now in the year 1807
appeared the long looked-for and much discussed Gaelic originals
of the Ossianic translations published some forty years previously.
The following is the title-page in full:—“The Poems of Ossian, in
the Original Gaelic, with a literal translation into Latin, by the
late Robert Macfarlane, A.M., together with a Dissertation on the
Authenticity of the Poems by Sir John Sinclair, Bart., and a translation
from the Italian of the Abbe Cessarotti’s Dissertation on
the Controversy respecting the Authenticity of Ossian, with Notes
and a Supplementary Essay, by John McArthur, LL.D., published
under the sanction of the Highland Society of London. <i lang="la">Magna

names], 1807, pp. ccxxxii., 278.</p>

<p>“<span lang="gd">Dana Oisen Mhic Fhinn, air an cur amach air son maith

<p>This last is a copy of the Gaelic text contained in Sir John
Sinclair’s <a id="tn-196">magnificent edition</a> of Ossian. It was printed at the
expense of Sir J. Macgregor Murray and other gentlemen that it
might be distributed among the Highlanders to cultivate and to
preserve their old chivalrous spirit. There was a copy sent for
the use of every parish school in the Highlands. These copies
were addressed to the care of the parish ministers, in whose hands
they generally remained. One thing is certain, they never reached
nor became known amongst the people in the manner in which
other books circulated amongst them.</p>

<p>Here were the Gaelic originals of Ossian at last; and certainly
there was no great reason to regret the delay in their appearance,
when they were now presented in so splendid a dress. Surely now
all controversy about them should cease for ever. All Gaelic-speaking
Highlanders thought so then; and there are many who
think similarly still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>This text was not exactly as it came from Macpherson’s hands,
who died while preparing it for the press. A standard of Celtic
orthography was then in course of formation; and John Mackenzie,
Esq., of London, one of Macpherson’s executors, engaged
the Rev. Dr Thomas Ross to write out with him the text of
Ossian in the style adopted by the excellent translators of the
Gaelic Bible. Dr Ross, although well acquainted with the language,
was not the most accurate scholar of his day. So until
Clerk’s “Ossian” appeared in 1870 there was no fairly correct and
scholarly text of these poems. Had the text come from Macpherson’s
own hands, the orthography would probably have been very
different. Macpherson enjoyed neither the time nor the practice
in writing the language to enable him to write either consistently
with himself or with any system of orthography. What he wrote,
or took down, or copied at an earlier period, of which we have a
fair specimen in the 7th Book of “Temora,” published with the
translations, is like what many educated Highlanders of the
present day would write. When conducting Highland periodicals,
the writer frequently received articles from gentlemen with some
reputation for Gaelic scholarship which were much in the style of
Macpherson’s orthography. Yet these same gentlemen might be,
as some of them were, profoundly acquainted with the vocabulary
and idioms of the language, although they were unable to
write consistently with their own or any other mode of spelling;
and were they poets of first-class genius, they could produce, as
far as acquaintance with the language was concerned, poetry like
that of Ossian, Macdonald, or Macintyre, the last of whom could
not write at all; whilst it will not be seriously contended that
Ossian was so familiar with the pen as he was ever with the sword.
The state of the text at any time since it was first moulded in
Macpherson’s hands could not be of the slightest value in deciding
the age of the poems. Neither could it be of more service philologically
than any other Gaelic books printed during the last hundred
years. It could have no value like <cite>The Book of Deer</cite>, and
<cite>The Book of the Dean of Lismore</cite>.</p>

<p>Though a very inviting field, it is not here intended to enter
into examination of the words of the text. When this question
has been competently investigated some of our views which at
present waver will be thoroughly confirmed.</p>

<p>Let the question of the authenticity be in the meantime laid
aside, and let the poems as they are be considered. One thing
is certain—they are the clever productions of a Gaelic genius—of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
a master whose works have influenced the literature of modern
Europe. The healthy and grand old figure of Ossian appeared on
the scene of the artificial literary world of the eighteenth century,
and his tenderness, his naturalness, and his keen sympathies with
the external world of form, of colour, and of movement carried
before him the conventionalities of a hollow generation. Ossian,
along with Cowper, was the first influence at work in bringing
back the rising poets of the day to the study and contemplation of
nature. The poems were translated into all the languages of
Europe. This “most magnificent mystification of modern times,”
as a German writer has described Ossian, acted like a spell on
poets in this country and on the Continent. Goethe and Lamartine
felt the force of this spell; the former acknowledged it in the
“Songs of Selma” in “Werther,” and the latter in “Memoirs of
my Youth.” The illustrious French poet has vividly described in
the following passage the enthusiastic admiration of Ossian that
prevailed in France in his younger days.</p>

<p>“It was now the period when Ossian, that poet of the genius of
ruins and battles, reigned paramount in the imagination of France.
Baour-Lormian had translated him into sonorous verse for the
camp of the emperor. Women sung him in plaintive romances,
or in triumphal strains, at the departure, above the tomb, or on
the return of their lovers. Small editions in portable volumes had
found their way into all the libraries. One of them fell into my
hands. I plunged into this ocean of shadow, of blood, of tears,
of phantoms, of foam, of snow, of fogs, of hoar frosts, and of
images, the immensity, the dimness, and the melancholy of which
harmonise so well with the lofty sadness of a heart of sixteen
which expands to the first rays of the Infinite. Ossian, his
localities, and his images harmonised wonderfully also with
the nature of the mountain district, almost Scottish in its
character, with the season of the year, and with the melancholy
aspect of the places where I read him. It was during the biting
blasts of November and December. The earth was covered with
a mantle of snow, pierced here and there by the black trunks of
scattered pines, or overhung by the naked and branching arms of
the oaks, upon which flights of crows assembled, filling the air
with their coarse cawings. Icy fogs clothed the branches with hoar
frost, clouds swept in eddying wreaths around the buried peaks
of the mountains. A few streams of sunshine streamed for a
moment through their openings, and discovered distant perspective
of unfathomable valleys, which the eye might fancy gulfs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
the sea. It was the natural and sublime exposition of the poems
of Ossian which I held in my hand. I carried him in my hunting
pouch over the mountains, and while the dogs made the deep
gorges of the hills echo with their barking, I read his pages, sitting
beneath the shelter of some overhanging rock, only raising my
eyes from its pages to find again, floating along the horizon or
outstretched at my feet, the same mists, the same clouds, the
same plains of ice or snow which I had just beheld in imagination.
How often have I felt my tears congealing on the borders of my
eyelids! I had become one of the sons of the bard, one of the
heroic, amorous, or plaintive shades who fought, who loved, who
wept, or who swept the fingers across the harp in the gloomy
domains of Fingal.”</p>

<p>In Italy the influence of Ossian was supreme. Cesarotti tells
us that he became the founder of a school of poetry there.
Throughout the literary world the power of Ossian’s muse was
felt. The artificiality, hollowness, and conventionality of the last
quarter of the eighteenth century rendered the natural echoes of
the grand old voice of Cona a fresh music and a welcome relief.</p>

<p>There are two complete translations of these Gaelic poems
before the world besides Macpherson’s—Macgregor’s and Clerk’s.
The last is absolutely literal, while Macgregor’s is also pretty faithful
to the Gaelic. Both versions are neither blank verse, nor
rhyme, nor prose, but are couched in a species of rhythmic verse in
lines of various lengths. Neither the one nor the other is ever
likely to become popular, so that a literal popular version is still
required for those whom Macpherson’s own cannot satisfy. I
have thrown into a very literal blank verse the whole of <i>Carrick</i>,
from which I take the following description of Finn’s encounter
with the Ghost of Lodin. It is a fair specimen of the poems as a
whole, and gives us an inkling of their mythology, which here and
elsewhere is vague and <span class="nowrap">shadowy:—</span></p>

<p>As formerly remarked, the “Old Lays” of Dr Smith are fully
as interesting and poetical as Macpherson’s Ossian; and all who
wish to read and enjoy good Gaelic poetry—fresh and idiomatic —should
go to these lays. Smith’s own translation is exceedingly
loose and turgid as compared with his Gaelic. As already
observed, Smith also comes under the suspicion of being the
author of the Gaelic, as well as translator. His own account of
the translation has been already given; and there seems no good
reason why its honesty and correctness should be doubted. His
Gaelic originals appear to stand in the same relation to pre-existent
ballad and taleologic literature that Burns’ new versions of Scottish
songs and ballads sustain to the older and original productions.
Like Macpherson, Dr Smith cannot be said to be wholly the
author nor merely the translator of these grand poetical “lays.”
Illustrative specimens of them are given in the next chapter. To
furnish a contrast to Macpherson’s Ossian and manner, I give the
following lines on <i lang="gd">Bas Airt</i>, or the Death of <span class="nowrap">Artho:—</span></p>

<p><i lang="gd">Dan an Deirg</i>, one of the finest poems in Smith’s volume, has
been recently translated, edited, and annotated by an accomplished
English scholar and graduate of Cambridge, Mr C. S. Jerram,
who has been at the pains of studying the language. To
this interesting little volume is prefixed a very intelligent and fair
account of the state of the Ossianic question.</p>

<p>Dr Smith’s “Old Lays,” translated by himself in too free and
turgid a fashion, are as interesting as Macpherson’s “Ossian,” and
not inferior in any respect to that famed production. In the opening
of one of these “lays,” called “Finan and Lorma,” we find a
very pretty set of verses in which the young people around him,
looking upon the heavens, are represented as addressing the aged
Ossian in the following <span class="nowrap">manner:—</span></p>

The original of the specimens which follow was well known before
Macpherson’s Gaelic Ossian appeared. The famous “Address to

published Gaelic of 1807 its place is marked by asterisks. The
Gaelic is inserted to correspond with the English in Clerk’s edition.

<p class="noindent">It is said that this address, the original of which was supplied to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
the Highland Society in the year 1801, was well known in the central
Highlands early in the eighteenth century. The Rev. Mr
Macdiarmid wrote it down from the dictation of an old man in
Glenlyon about 1770. It is said that this old man learned it in his
youth from people in the same glen before Macpherson was born.</p>

<p>The “Address to the Setting Sun” is given at the beginning of
Macpherson’s <i lang="gd">Carricthura</i>. It consists of eleven lines, and has
been a great favourite among the people. The following is a
literal <span class="nowrap">translation:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Leav’st the blue distance of the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unsullied Sun, with tress of gold?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where west thy tent of slumber lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The portals of the night unfold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cautious billows cower nigher</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy shining temples to behold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awe-struck, their heads they lift up higher</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To view thee grand in thy repose!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pale from thy side they back retire!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May in thy cave sleep o’er thee close,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O, Sun! till thou the dawn inspire.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1 noindent">The above lines were written down by Mr Macdiarmid at the
same time as the “Address to the Sun.” In the two pieces we
find abstract conceptions that we never come across in the old
ballads. This gives real ground to the argument of <a id="tn-204">recent
writers</a> that the poems are of modern date. Whether ancient
or modern, they are poetry of a high order, superior to that of
the Irish and Scottish ballads. The new theory seems to some
inconsistent with the honour and veracity of more than one clergyman
and gentleman of repute, who could have no personal interest
in helping to palm on the public the alleged forgeries of
Macpherson. There is another “Address to the Sun”—to the
rising sun—in Dr Smith’s Old Lays, which appeared many years
before the publication of Macpherson’s Gaelic. It is admirably
translated by Mr Pattison, and I avail myself of his <span class="nowrap">translation:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent2">In what cave do bright stars end their race—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When fast, on their faded steps bending,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like a hunter you rush through the sky,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">While down yon far summits they fly?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pleasant thy path is, Great Lustre, wide-gleaming,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Dispelling the storm with thy rays;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And graceful thy gold ringlets streaming,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As wont in the westering blaze.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee the blind mist of night ne’er deceiveth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor sends from the right course astray!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The strong tempest, all ocean that grieveth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Can ne’er make thee bend from thy way.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At the call of the mild morn appearing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy festal face wakens up bright;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy shade from all dark places clearing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the bard’s eye that ne’er sees thy light.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In an Irish poem from which quotations have been <a id="tn-205">made the
bard</a> is represented as blind. In two of these pieces we have
touching allusion to the same melancholy infliction. “Vain to
me are thy bright rays” occurs in the Address to the Sun, and
“the bard’s eye that ne’er sees thy light” in the Address to the
Rising Sun. The soul of the old poet seemed to take delight in
contrasting his own sightless condition with the brilliant sun in his
course through the heavens. This tone of melancholy pleasure—of
deep and lonely nurtured feeling—so characteristic of the
Ossianic poems, is <a id="tn-205a">also characteristic</a> of the Celtic race, especially
of the Scottish Gael, whose spirit seems to have been enswathed
in the majestic gloom of his own native glens and mountains.
The curtains of mist hanging over the silent and weird-looking
lochs, the ghost-like clouds that glided across the glens or inwrapped
the crests of the hills, the moan of the sounding seashore
mingling with the roar of a hundred streams forcing their
ways to join the boundless ocean, are sights and sounds which
naturally exerted a powerful influence on the souls of those who
lived daily in their midst. When the tempests darkened round
the earth, and lightnings flashed, and the hoarse-voiced thunder
shook the hills, how pleasant it must have been for the depressed
spirit of man to gaze on the face of the sun, looking “fair through
the storm” “upon the troubled heavens under” of a Hebridean
sky!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>These are specimens of a great deal of poetry which Highlanders
of the present day unhesitatingly ascribe to Ossian. Indeed,
the Ossian of these pieces appears to be a poet of quite a
different calibre from that of the old ballads. One thing is clear
that whoever was the author or authors of these much discussed
productions, he or they were poets of the highest order, and must
have been Gaels born and bred in the Highlands.</p>

<p class="p1">After the Celtic poems and translations of the Bard of Badenoch
had begun to realise fame and fortune for their author, other
writers of varying gifts sought to enter into similar labours. For
literary students the Gaelic realm of letters hitherto had been
obscure and untrodden fields; but now all at once the old Celtic
world of the Scottish past became alive with heroes of magnificent
deeds and bards of illustrious renown. The refinement, the culture,
the heroic courage of grand old Scots, in the environment of
the purest chivalry, kindled everywhere admiration throughout
Europe. People wearied of the artificialities and platitudes of the
eighteenth century, allowed themselves to get into raptures over
the healthy pictures of ancient life which these Celtic compositions
unfolded. The blind old Ossian was then more popular
than the blind old Homer, and all “Old Lays” connected with
the Highlands and Islands acquired a value which they never had
before. There was a general rage for Gaelic old lays and ballads,
and a search was instituted throughout the land for such productions.
Bards, senachies, reciters, and singers of every description
and every rank in life were requisitioned for the supply of ancient
Ossianic ballads.</p>

<p>One good result of this was to make the Highlands better
known, and to help in the removal of old race-prejudices which
had all along existed in some quarters, but which had become
greatly intensified through the recent Jacobite rebellions for which
the Highlanders as a people were not primarily responsible. John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Knox may be said to have made the Scotland of his time reforming,
radical, and religious, and Sir Walter Scott the Scotland of
the nineteenth century romantic in verse and story; and James
Macpherson may be said with equal force to have made the
Highlands in the eighteenth century. It has been said that old
Celtic lays and ballads became then the fashion. The pioneer in
the field, it ought to be remembered, however, was not the Badenoch
tutor. Three or four years before Macpherson was heard of
there died, in June 1756, in the 30th year of his age,</p>


<h3>JEROME STONE,</h3>

<p class="noindent">who was the first to direct public attention to Ossianic ballads.
He was born at Scoonie, Fifeshire, in 1727. His father was a
seafaring man. As a mere lad, Jerome became a packman; but
dealing in buckles, garters, and such small articles not suiting his
“superior genius,” he sold his stock, bought books, and finally
struggled into St. Andrews University, where he graduated in 1750.
He soon received the appointment of assistant in Dunkeld
Grammar School, of which he became Rector two or three years
afterwards. In this position, acquiring knowledge of the Gaelic
language and of the people, along with his other duties, he
remained until struck down of fever, as already stated, in 1756.
At that time Dunkeld, an ancient home of Celtic activity, learning,
and enterprise, was more of a Gaelic district than it is now
and Stone found himself in social and intellectual surroundings
which were new to him. He had probably more racial kinship,
with the people than he himself knew or acknowledged, or than
even Professor Mackinnon, who has edited his collection, has
thought of. For centuries Gaidel and Brython lived and fought
in his native Fifeshire, and their fervid life-blood has never ceased
to run in the veins of Fife men. Probably the eloquent Thomas
Chalmers received much of the inspiration of his genius from this
Celtic source. Stone left a collection of Gaelic ballads which was
for some time regarded as lost. The MS., after passing through
various hands, passed two years ago into the possession of Edinburgh
University on the death of Dr Clerk, to whom it was given
when preparing his edition of Ossian, by David Laing. Professor
Mackinnon has published the collection of ballads in the Transactions
of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, 1887-88, occupying
fifty pages of the volume, and accompanied with an interesting
biographical note, to which the writer is indebted for some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
particulars given above. These ballads are of exactly the same
character as those of the Feinne already considered. They are
merely other versions of the same poems dealing with the same
themes of the Finnic environment of the old Gaelic national life.</p>

<p>The first translator of Gaelic poetry deserves a memorial cairn
in any book devoted to the interests of our Anglo-Gaelic literature.
Jerome Stone gave the first translation of the old Gaelic
Lays to the world in 1756 four years before the appearance of
Macpherson’s <i>Fragments</i>. It appears that a St. Andrews Professor
was the first to interest young Stone in Gaelic poetry, and the
best of his efforts at translation was his free rendering of “Fraoch’s
Death,” or as he entitles it, “Albin and the Daughter of
<span class="nowrap">Mey”:—</span></p>

<p>The hero’s death is a tragic one; and the life of the “helpless
maid!” vanishes in the usual tender regrets of bards. Our great
interest in the production, apart from the early death of the gifted
and sympathetic Stone, lies in the fact that he <a id="tn-211">was the
first</a> English-speaking man of letters who attempted to deal fairly
with the products of the Gaelic muse. To students of Macpherson’s
Ossian and Ossianic ballads it will be apparent that the Badenoch
tutor merely imitated Stone in the English productions; he gave
the spirit, not the letter of Gaelic poetry. Macpherson’s trouble
lay in the originally unexpected necessity of providing Gaelic
originals which would be fair equivalents for his published English
versions. The bitter assaults made on his works naturally led to
his manner of self-defence. As an illustration of how <em>poetical</em>
translators deal with the original materials placed in their hands,
nothing better could be found than this Gaelic ballad which Stone
published in English dress in the “Scots Magazine.” In “Mackenzie’s
Report,” the original Gaelic, Stone’s rendering, and a
literal version are supplied. The second is described as a “Translation
of the foregoing,” as published by Stone in the “Scots
Magazine” for 1756. In order to show how a “translation” was
regarded in the age of Macpherson, it may be well to give the
last three verses of “Fraoch’s Death” in the original, then the
“Report’s” literal version, and lastly Stone’s poetic translation.
Here are the last three verses of the Gaelic <span class="nowrap">ballad:—</span></p>

</div>

<p>This is the original material out of which Jerome Stone
wrought his translation as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">With me the hero to the grave attend,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Through his own grove his praise we will proclaim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bid the place forever bear his name.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The idea may come to many readers as a surprise that if Jerome
Stone had been spared to perform the part of translator of the
Gaelic ballads and small epics of the Finnic mythus, he would
probably furnish the world with “translations” which would not
be nearer the “originals” than Macpherson’s have been. The
reference here is not to Macpherson’s Gaelic published subsequently,
but to the Ossianic compositions which became such a
source of general Celtic inspiration during the latter half of the
eighteenth century.</p>


<h3>JOHN SMITH, D.D.</h3>

<p>This writer was among the most cultured and distinguished
of those who about a hundred years ago devoted time, means,
and talent to the study of Gaelic literature. The labours of the
Rev. Dr John Smith of Campbeltown, as an author and translator
of prose and poetry, were varied and abundant. He produced
a Life of Columba the Apostle of the Highlands; a work
on The Functions of the Sacred Office, which received the high
commendation of Dr Bickersteth; and a work on Gaelic Antiquities
and the History of the Druids, which is still sought after,
and which exhibits considerable research and good literary powers.
These works, in English, enable us to judge of the qualities of the
man in general; but it is with his Gaelic works that we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
chiefly to deal. He was one of those who helped to translate the
Old Testament into Gaelic, edited a version of the Gaelic Psalter,
another of the Shorter Catechism; and was the translator of some
religious works, such as <cite>Alleine’s Alarm</cite>. When engaged on the
last-mentioned production, which he undertook to translate at the
request of a lady, he took portions of the “Appeals to the Unconverted”
with him into the pulpit, being too busy to prepare
sermons of his own, with the result that a spiritual revival took
place in the congregation, and anxious hearers flocked to the
pastor for spiritual comfort which he felt himself totally unable to
supply. It is said that this experience led to an emphatic spiritual
change in himself.</p>

<p>How Smith was moved to interest himself in Gaelic poetry is well
described in his own language in a letter to the Highland Society
Committee: “(31st January 1798), I can only say that from my
earliest years I was accustomed to hear many of the poems of
Ossian and many tales respecting Fingal and his heroes. In the
parish of Glenurchay, in which I was born, and lived till the age
of 17, there were many at that time who could repeat a number of
Ossian’s poems; and there was particularly an old man called
Doncha (rioch) Macnicol, who was noted for reciting the greatest
store of them. That any of them had been translated, I did not
know till I became a student in philosophy, when, in the year
1766 or 1767, I read Mr Macpherson’s translation, with which,
beautiful as it is, I was by no means so much charmed as I had
been with the oral recitation of such as I heard of the poems in
the original language. The elegance of the modern dress did not,
therefore, in my opinion, compensate for the loss of the venerable
and ancient garb.” When it became doubtful whether Macpherson
would publish the Gaelic originals, Smith formed the
design of publishing as many as he could of the originals, which
“at that time would not be a few.” “But,” he proceeds, “finding
there was no encouragement to be expected for such a work,
and that those which I had already collected would not defray
their own expence, nor have been ever published had it not been
for the liberal support and patronage of the Highland Society of
London, I gave up the pursuit of Gaelic poetry; about which I
became so careless that I never took the trouble of transcribing
or preserving several pieces that had fallen into my possession.”
Smith is not the only one to whom the “pursuit of Gaelic poetry”
and Celtic studies became a painful and barren enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>It appears that Duncan Kennedy, a schoolmaster at Lochgilphead,
busied himself in collecting, transcribing, and editing in his
own peculiar manner all the old Highland lays he could find in
Argyllshire, and that some of his materials found their way into
Smith’s possession. It is understood that the latter refers to Kennedy
in the following sentences: “(1802), I remember well,”—Kennedy
was still alive,—“that a man who had given me the use
of a parcel of poems, without any restriction, had long threatened
a prosecution for publishing what he called translations of his
collection of poems, and alleged he had a claim to a share of the
profits. I believe, however, upon enquiry, that he understood the
profits were only a serious loss, as I had been persuaded to run
shares with a bookseller in the publication, which to me turned
out so bad a concern (when my income was but thirty pounds a-year),
that I could never since think of Gaelic poetry with pleasure
or with patience, except to wish it had been dead before I was
born.” In this same letter Smith declares that a little while
before he had used the last copy he had of his Translations “in
papering a dark closet that had not been lathed, in order to derive
some small benefit from what had cost” him so much. Macpherson
reaped the first crop of the ancient lays of the Celtic world of
romance; piled a fortune out of it; became a member of Parliament;
bought a Highland estate on which he erected a monument
for himself; and arranged for the burial of his body in Westminster
Abbey. Some of his imitators found the path of Celtic studies
and poetry one of thorns, poverty and misfortune, and obscure
graves, without a cairn to mark their resting-place.</p>

<p>Smith’s Collection of Ancient Poems appeared in 1780, subjoined
to the Dissertations on Gaelic Antiquities. These poems
were translations, it was declared, “from the Gaelic of Ossian,
Ullin, Orran, and others;” and in 1787 he published the originals
of these poems, the number being fourteen. Their titles are:
<cite>The Lay of the Red</cite>; <cite>The Death of Gaul</cite>; <cite>The Lay of Duhona</cite>;
<cite>Diarmid</cite>; <cite>Clan-Morni</cite>, or <cite>Finan and Lorma</cite>, from which following
lines are taken to show the character of the verse and mode of

<p>The above Albha, Alva, is Allen in Ireland, and has no connection
with Alban, with which, however, it has been often confounded
in the old ballads. Ultra patriotic Scotchmen have frequently,
likely in ignorance, rendered the Irish Almhuin into
Albin. This mistake occurs in Mr Pattison’s <cite>Gaelic Bards</cite>.

<p class="p1 center fs90"><em>Translation.</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But Ossian alone does not experience distress; aged Lugar, thine was part
of the trouble. In thy halls were seen the feast, wax candles, and wine;
though they be now desolate, they were once the residence of kings!
But similar to the revolving year, Lugar and his beloved wife were seen
houseless.</p>

<p>Travelling through the vales of beautiful Moialuin, the habitation of
Lugar was found desolate, the kid broused on its green surface, stretching
itself in sleep in the once joyous dwelling. In its window was the bird of
night, and green ivy shaded its desolate walls, the greyhound and dun roe
surrounded them, and his hospitable door lies sorrowful under the falling
rains.</p>

<p>Sons of the hill, have you seen Lugar? Probably you rejoice that he
is no more. But you shall decline like him, and your relations will one day
inquire for you. Your children will shake their heads with sorrow, they
know not the place of your abode!</p>

<p>The vicissitudes of life are similar to those of the year. I lived void of
trouble in the summer of youth, like firs on the green Mor-uth, careless of
the storms of winter. I thought my verdant leaves would remain, and that
age would not injure my branches. But now I am forlorn like thyself, and
my aged locks are on the wings of the wind; our joyful days are both gone
on the wings of the blast to the desert.</p>
</div>

<p>The passage just given explains Smith’s failure to impress the
public with his prose versions of Old Lays. It affords quite a
contrast to the style of Macpherson, which was sententious and
clarified by a Saxon as simple as that of the English Bible. In his
Life of Columba, Smith gave translated specimens of the Saints’
Latin Hymns, of which an extract has been already given (p. 69).
He rendered this passage of the <i lang="la">Altus prosatur</i> in blank verse—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
beginning of the same in rhymed metre by the writer being else
where supplied (p. 81). The following lines by Smith, accompanying
the Gaelic of <i>Taura</i>, show that he appeared to better
advantage in verse than in prose <span class="nowrap">translations:—</span></p>

so “close and well-set,” that a good translation is not easily executed.</p>

<p>This “Vision of a Fair Woman” has nothing in common

no one reading it can fail to remember the poetry of Moore, and
recognise the Celtic source of the bright peculiarity of his
melodious muse.</p>


<h3>JOHN CLARK,</h3>

<p class="noindent">a land-surveyor in Badenoch, the county of James Macpherson,
published in 1780 a small volume of translations of ancient Gaelic
poetry under the title of “Caledonian Bards.” Among other
pieces is a poem entitled <i lang="gd">Mordubh</i>, whose history is even more
mysterious than that of the work of “Ossian.” The translations
in this volume are the most unreadable stuff that one could
imagine. Clark, and even Smith, failed to catch the secret that
enabled Macpherson to pour forth his inimitable prose epics.
Clark’s prose is frequently turgid nonsense, and it is rendered
ridiculous by his coining of proper names out of unnatural collocations
of adjectives. The “ingenious Mrs Grant of Laggan” put
some of the surveyor’s poetry into verse, and thought she was
handling ancient poetic material instead of eighteenth-century
stuff, which might be creditable enough were it not presented to
the public under a false garb. She knew the “gentleman’s
character,” and “the circumstance of his father and grandfather
being great Gaelic scholars and collectors, who most probably
had an opportunity of obtaining such poems which were not
within her reach.” The pious and honest Mrs Grant never fancied
that this family of Clarks and others at that time might spin
out such stuff as they palmed on the public, with or without
ancient lays to help them. It is the volume of this Badenoch
surveyor that finally and fully opened the eyes of the writer to the
truth respecting the Ossianic productions of the last century.
Clark and Kennedy were men of considerable gifts;—if they had
used them with greater honesty the cause of Gaelic literature
would not have been so involved in suspicion a hundred years
ago. Their labours, however, have not been lost. Kennedy’s
manuscript collections of poetry, safely deposited in Edinburgh,
have great value, and Clark may be said to have produced a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
Gaelic composition of some ability. Special efforts seem to have
been made to get this conglomerate of <i lang="gd">Mordubh</i> into appreciative
circulation. It imposed on Mrs Grant, as we have seen. In a
stray number of the “General Chronicle” for February 1811,
which the writer found in London a few years ago, <a id="tn-220">part of <i lang="gd">Mordubh</i></a>,
with a literal translation, is published; and the clever
editor of “The Beauties of Gaelic Poetry” commenced his splendid
volume with this poem of <em>The Great-Black</em>, with a foot-note
which says: “The author of this poem, whose name is Douthal,
was both a chief and a bard of great repute. The accounts which
tradition gives of him are various, but the most probable makes
him the Poet of Mordubh, King of the Caledonians.” This was
a more ancient and illustrious ancestry for the author of the poem
than the genuine producer, John Clark of Badenoch, could
boast of.</p>

<p>The Gaelic fragment, as given in the “General Chronicle,”
begins thus in <span class="nowrap">Gaelic:—</span></p>

<p class="p1">John Clark was a third-rate imitator, whose imitations were
almost parodies. He had neither the learning nor the genius of
either Smith or Macpherson, who must henceforth be regarded as
great Highland bards. These two, no doubt, caused much confusion
among our heroic lays. <a id="tn-220a">James Macpherson</a> and Dr John
Smith helped to give fresh currency to many of the false etymologies
and Druidical ideas that have afflicted the Gaelic world for
the last century. They have mystified our Ossianic poems and
ballads, as well as the pre-Christian religion of the Caledonians.
They turned upside down our early history, and placed our
relations to the Irish on a false basis, <a id="tn-220b">creating unnecessary</a> antagonism
between the Celts of the two countries. But honour to
whom honour is due. If no James Macpherson had ever
appeared, our Highland Ossian would have been as obscure, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
as the extant Oisins of Ireland. In some respects he
was the greatest genius that the Highlands ever produced, and
ought not to be regarded with so much contemptuous indifference.
He had a most peculiar gift for executing prose translation, notwithstanding
the failure of his Homer. In this one respect he
was much superior to Dr Smith, who, however, had the advantage
of Macpherson in greater power of sweet Gaelic versification.
Smith was a born poet; all his works are evidences. The two
did their best to show forth the historic, linguistic, and poetic
glories of the Gael and his country; so let us drop a tear on their
cairns and pass on.</p>

<span class="fs70">GENERAL LITERATURE.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is easy to disparage the study of these scanty remains of a literary
language which, though it be not dead, is more of an unknown tongue to
our modern men of letters than almost any other.”—<span class="smcap">Dr Joseph Anderson.</span></p>
</div>


<p>The intellectual activity created in the sixteenth century led to
the formation of a new literature for the diffusion of the new learning.
This literature belongs to that period in our national history
when religious ferment, political and ecclesiastical change, began
to operate effectually on the mind of modern Europe. The first
Gaelic effort in this direction was by John Carsuel, superintendent
of the diocese of Argyll, who translated and published (1567)
John Knox’s Prayer-Book. The English original was printed at
Edinburgh in 1565, and the Gaelic version appeared within two
years after that date. It is the first Gaelic book that ever was
printed either in Scotland or Ireland. Only three copies were
known to exist previous to 1872; one perfect copy in possession
of the Duke of Argyll, and two imperfect copies, one in the Edinburgh
University Library and the other in the British Museum.
In 1872 the Rev. Dr Maclauchlan made a complete transcript
of the book, and a new edition was published page for page and
line for line with the original. Philologists regard it as very
valuable. Bishop Carsuel was a native of Kilmartin, well versed
in the Gaelic language, and thoroughly acquainted with the people
of the wide district of whose spiritual interests he had charge. In
an address prefixed to his book he alludes to the manuscript
literature then extant, “written in manuscript books in the compositions
of poets and ollaves, and in the remains of learned
men.” The bishop seems to have imbibed something of the
earnest, critical spirit of nineteenth-century Christianity, and
deserves our respect for giving us the first printed book in Gaelic.</p>

<p>Still it is unfortunate for Gaelic literature, though perhaps not for
the Protestant religion, that he and others determined on the ruthless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
extinction of the popular ballads among the people. The
<i lang="gd">Ursgeuls</i>, or prose tales, were condemned even with greater emphasis.
The following verses from a ballad from which an extract
has been taken already will show the character of the popular
literature which Carsuel did not consider <span class="nowrap">edifying:—</span></p>

<p>Earnest Reformers could not regard this sort of literature as a
powerful auxiliary in the recasting of a nation’s faith; so Carsuel
thought the Gaelic population would benefit spiritually by the substitution
of his own Gaelic liturgy for the popular songs and tales.</p>

<p>Ossian’s “Prayer” appears to have been treated with disparagement
by the Highlanders of last century as well, especially by the
“clerics,” who were such a source of annoyance to poor Ossian
himself while he lived. One feels inclined to ask, after reading
some of the old ballads, whether the Patrick who described all the
ancient Finians as in hell, was a species of the modern Protestant,
so well represented by the late valiant Dr Begg and the late Dr
Cumming. Whether or not it is evident that he was a persistent
Protestant against the heathenism of the Féinne, indeed quite a
thorn in the side of the poor old bard. The Irish monks of later
days, however, appear to have taken very kindly to the laureate of
the Fingalians, and to have lopped off many of the excrescences
of the faithful Patrick. Scottish ecclesiastics appropriated the
new Irish versions, but pruned off the excrescences with which
the Basque, or Spano-Iberian imagination of the south-west of
Ireland, had clothed the simple originals. Carsuel, in the sixteenth
century, under the pressure of Reformation doctrines, was
the first to touch unkindly the hoary locks of the ancient bard.
The Féinne and their singer, however, survived in the affections
and traditions of the population, until the Gospel according to the
English Puritans and our own Scottish Covenanters began to out-root
entirely the semi-heathen and Finian ideals of the people.
So now in many districts of the Highlands, and throughout
the Islands, much to the disgust of students of folk-lore, like
Campbell of Islay, the only singing you hear is, not the rehearsal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
of the old heroic lays or the Ossianic duans, but the Psalms of
David or the hymns of Sankey. As already remarked, the
“clerics” of last century treated the Ossianic compositions with as
little respect as Patrick, Carsuel, or Spurgeon would. At the
end of a copy of Ossian’s Prayer there is a stanza by Duncan
Rioch Macnicol, who was then styled the “Modern Ossian,”
very much in the fashion of our present day Gaelic bards, who
dub themselves as of this or that ilk. Duncan, whose feelings
towards the old bards must have been <i lang="gd">rioch</i> enough, describes poor
Ossian in the following terms, given already in the original
(p. 87), in sending the copy to the Rev. Donald Macnicol,
<span class="nowrap">Lismore:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">To Master Donald take this story;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There he dwells beside the billow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The prayer said by Ossian hoary,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who was aye a worthless fellow.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1 noindent">The last line is a condensation—though Duncan Rioch was probably
in a fit of humour, supposed to be a rare state of soul for a
Highland Celt—of the Protestant or Evangelic disposition of
Patrick, Carsuel, and Peter Grant. These remarks have been suggested
by the specimen of Gaelic which follows. Specimens have
already been given of the style of writing ancient Gaelic from the
earliest period down to the beginning of the sixteenth century.
To those who may have paid a little attention to them it may
have been interesting to discern the gradual change which Gaelic
has undergone, until we find it about 1600 beginning to take the
Scottish form out of which our present standard of the Gaelic
Bible has been <span class="nowrap">developed:—</span></p>

<p>The Highland love of Paganism was destined to flourish
down to our own time, a Stornoway woman having been seen
worshipping the moon as recently as the beginning of the present
century, the parish minister of Uig at the time being the witness.</p>

<p>In his Hibbert Lectures (1888) Professor Rhys says—“It is
worthy of note that this kind of Paganism died hard in the islands
on the Armoric coast; in fact it lasted, in spite of Church and
State, down to the time of the Norsemen’s ravages.” Fifteen centuries
of vigorous Christianity have not yet extirpated the serpent
of superstition in the British Islands.</p>

<p>After the publication of Carsuel’s Book of Prayers, which led
the way, the only species of literature that the press helped to diffuse
for more than a century was of an ecclesiastical or religious
character. In the seventeenth century appeared a translation of
Calvin’s Catechism, “<i lang="gd">Faoseid Eoin Stiubhairt</i>,” the Synod of
Argyll’s translation of the Psalter, the Confession of Faith in the
eighteenth century, followed by catechisms and summaries of
Christian doctrine. Endeavours were made to awaken the people
out of the spiritual lethargy induced by the age of inaction which
preceded the Reformation era. The only successful way to reach
the heart of the people was felt to be through the medium of their
native tongue. Towards the close of the last century, for this
end, translations of all sorts of religious works became numerous,
even Roman Catholic Highlanders having a bulky volume of a
summary of Christian doctrine translated for their use.</p>

<p>During this time the Highlanders had no version of the Scriptures
in <a id="tn-226">their own tongue</a>, Welshmen and Irishmen being favoured
earlier than they in this respect. The first portion translated was
the Psalter by the Synod of Argyll in 1659. The Bible was not
much known in the north-west at this period. A few individuals
possessed the Irish version, but this was never much in practical
use. Preachers used the English Bible, of which they gave their own
extemporaneous translation as they went along. A good specimen
of written Gaelic towards the end of the seventeenth century will
be found in the Rev. Robert Kirk’s preface to his metrical version
of the Book of Psalms. To the ordinary reader it is hardly distinguishable
from the Irish of the same period. The Highlander
will be glad to have an opportunity of reading in his own language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
such an eloquent encomium on the Psalms which he prizes so
so dearly.</p>

wonder-working God; and David is ever one of the company who are thus

</div>

<p>The Highland clergy at this time were, as a class, fairly well-educated.
This will be seen in the accounts of English travellers
who now began to take tours to the Celtic north-west. In earlier
times the intercourse between the Highlands and the great world
beyond was greater than in the seventeenth century. Before the
seats of government were all removed from the districts of the
Gael further south, the communication with Ireland and the Continent
of Europe in the north and in France was considerable. Till
the days of Queen Elizabeth relations were fitfully sustained between
the insular court of the Princedom of the Isles and the
English Court. It was during the seventeenth century that the
Gaelic regions became a very <i lang="la">terra incognita</i> to South Britain.
Now a learned and sympathetic visitor arrived, from whose pages
we get glimpses of the state of learning and culture among the
Gaels.</p>

<p>It is a Welshman, Professor Rhys of Oxford, that has given us
the best work on Celtic philology and Celtic paganism, in the
present day; and it was a Welshman that wrote the best book on
the same subjects upwards of 200 years ago. Edward Lhuyd’s great
work on Celtic scholarship appeared in 1707. The title runs

collections and observations in travels through Wales, Cornwall,
Bas-Bretagne, Ireland, and Scotland. By Edward Lhuyd, M.A. of
Jesus College, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
Oxford: Printed at the Theater for the author, MDCCVII.”
Were the matter within the bounds of the 460 folio pages of this
handsome volume printed in the style in which books are now
generally published it would make three or four very considerable
volumes. At the beginning of an appendix the following note
occurs: “Having since the printing this Irish dictionary sent copies
to Ireland and Scotland in order to have it improved, the following
supplement consists chiefly of some notes returned thence by two
gentlemen well known to be able scholars and masters of that
language.” It is in connection with these “copies,” I suppose,
that the poetical complimentary verses inserted at the beginning of
the volume were sent to the author. These verses were written in
Latin, Gaelic, and Welsh. Two or three Latin ones and four in
Gaelic are sent from the Highlands. The character of this great
work may be gathered from the titles of the several departments:
Comparative Etymology, 40 pp.; A Comparative Vocabulary
<a id="tn-228">of the Original</a> Languages of Britain and Ireland, 130 pp.; An
Armoric Grammar and Vocabulary, 33 pp.; Some Welsh Words,
A Cornish Grammar, British MSS., and a British Etymologican,
86 pp.; A Brief Introduction to the Irish or Ancient Scottish
Language, and <i lang="gd">Foclair Gaoidheilge-Shasonach no Bearladoir Scot-Sagsamhuil</i>;
An Irish-English Dictionary, 136 pp.; two pp. describing
Gaelic MSS., and An Index. In the preface he proceeds to
explain what induced him “to an undertaking so laborious, so
little diverting, and so much out of the common road.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how this laborious Oxford student met
the prejudices of the day. The undertaking “proceeded not
from any conceited opinion, as some might be apt to imagine, of
the plausibleness of these languages. Most of us commonly hear
or read too much to be ignorant that the generality of people are
rather disposed to a ridiculing than a favourable reception of anything
in that kind. This did not, I own, in the least discourage
me, as well knowing that the same prejudice in the like case prevails
in all other great governments, and that in any uncommon
undertaking the judgment of men of distinction (or at least particular
experience in the subject proposed), is to be only regarded.
The inducement I had was no other than a seeming probability
that such an essay might in this curious age contribute not a little
towards a clearer notion of the first planters of the three kingdoms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and a better understanding of our ancient names of persons and
places.” No grammar of the Scottish Gaelic appeared up to the
time of Lhuyd; but he speaks of “a Scotish gentleman who had
some thoughts of publishing” one. It would be interesting to
know who this gentleman was; perhaps he was one of those who
sent the poetical addresses to Lhuyd.</p>

<p>In connection with this great work Lhuyd experienced the same
discouragements which often beset similar works of learning. He
was told by some considerate critic that his volume would meet
with but a cold reception; for it consisted “only of etymology
and Welsh and Irish vocabularies.” The critic exclaims, “Now
there are not half a dozen or half a score in the kingdom that are
curious in that way. The world expected, according to his promise
and undertaking, a natural history, which is a study of established
request, and that a great many are curious in.” But Lhuyd has
in the published list the names of two hundred lords, knights, and
gentlemen of learning and distinction belonging to England alone.
This was something to begin with for such a work, and must have
been rather a disconcerting refutation of the critic’s remark about
“half a dozen” readers. It is quite possible that this complaining
critic looked forward to an interesting dissertation on the strange
human animals that inhabited in those days Lorn, Mull, and Islay,
and other Celtic parts. He and others could scarcely realise to
themselves that the Celtic barbarians who dwelt in those distant
regions could write and talk good English; and in their leisure
hours exercised themselves in the composition of Latin verse or
Gaelic poetry.</p>

<p>Lhuyd was accompanied everywhere on his travels by David
Parry, A.B. of Jesus College, Oxford, who wrote a small section of
the work. It is a very interesting picture that the travels of these
learned Oxonians in the Highlands suggest seventy or eighty years
before the mighty Johnson visited the Western Isles, which in
earlier ages were so well known throughout the ecclesiastical world.
Here is a specimen of Latin verse from the pen of a Highland
minister two hundred years <span class="nowrap">ago:—</span></p>

<p class="p1">The Gaelic addresses are highly interesting to the philologist, as
showing Scottish Gaelic in a transition state. At the period of
Lhuyd’s visit to the Highlands and Isles, and down to the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
of last century, the Highland clergyman wrote either in Latin or
Gaelic. It was at that time, also, that the Scottish Gael began to
depart from the old style of Gaelic writing and orthography.
This departure might have been dictated to some extent by a Protestant
feeling, but was mainly caused by the desire to make the
orthography exactly expressive of the popular speech. The difference
between the Irish and Scottish dialects was rendered greater
by the change. Highland clergymen of that period being of the
better families throughout the country, were generally well-educated
gentlemen. Even generations after, we find more
literary talent than can be found in many places to-day.</p>

<p>A glimpse of the state of the country after the gory struggle
which ended on Culloden Moor shows a far higher state of
literary culture than an outsider would readily believe possible
in the circumstances. The Ossianic controversy which subsequently
arose brought forward the names of many clergymen who
during the last half of the eighteenth century were a credit to their
country. Such men were the Rev. James Calder and the Rev. Dr
Alexander Fraser, in the north-east; the Rev. Thomas Ross of
Lochbroom, the Rev. Mr Macqueen of Kilmuir, in Skye, and the
Rev. Dr Macpherson of Sleat, in the north-west; the Rev. Dr
John Macarthur of Mull, the Rev. Dr Macnicol of Lismore, Johnson’s
formidable opponent, the Rev. Mr Woodrow of Islay, and
the Rev. Dr John Smith of Campbeltown, with his accomplished
brother, Dr Donald Smith, in the south-west; the MacLaurins of
Cowal, the distinguished divine and the professor of mathematics,
the Stewarts, translators of the Bible, Professor Adam Ferguson of
Edinburgh, and Professor Macleod of Glasgow, the Rev. Dr Macintyre
of Glenorchay, Dr Grahame of Aberfoyle, and the Rev.
Messrs Macdiarmid, Gallie, and Maclagan, in the central Highlands.
The atmosphere in which such men breathed—and they were
scattered throughout all parts of the Highlands—could not be altogether
one of ignorance; and the large mass of the people were,
no doubt, largely benefited by the culture of and intercourse with
their clerical superiors.</p>

<p>Dr Samuel Johnson, notwithstanding many surly prepossessions,
besought, with that good broad honesty of his nature, such educated
Highlanders and Irishmen to furnish the world with correct
information regarding their language and literature. All English
readers know of his tour to the Hebrides, whither he journeyed
more than a century ago, in those days of difficult travelling, to
judge for himself concerning the people among whom appeared so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
remarkable a poet as Ossian. He did not visit Ireland, but early
in life he corresponded with an accomplished Irish gentleman,
Mr Charles O’Connor of Ballinegare, Roscommon, in relation to
Irish literature. In his first letter, April 9, 1737, he says:—“Sir
William Temple complains that Ireland is less known than any
other country as to its ancient state. The natives have had little
leisure and little encouragement for inquiry, and strangers, not
knowing the language, have had no ability. I have long wished
that Irish literature were cultivated. Ireland is known by tradition
to have been once the seat of piety and learning, and surely it
would be very acceptable to all those who are curious, either in the
original of nations, or the affinities of languages, to be further informed
of the revolutions of a people so ancient, and once so illustrious.”
He hopes O’Connor will continue his Irish studies, and
speaks of the great pleasure he has in hearing of the progress of
his undertaking. Twenty-two years afterwards Johnson renews the
correspondence, and complains of O’Connor disappointing him:—“I
expected great discoveries in Irish antiquities, and large publications
in the Irish language, but the world still remains as it was—doubtful
and ignorant. What the Irish language is in itself, and
to what languages it has affinity, are very interesting questions,
which every man wishes to see resolved that has any philological
or historical curiosity. Dr Leland begins his history too late; the
ages that deserve an exact inquiry are those times (for such they
were) when Ireland was the school of the west, the quiet habitation
of sanctity and literature. If you could give a history, though
imperfect, of the Irish nation from its conversion to Christianity to
the invasion from England, you would amplify knowledge with new
views and new objects. Set about it, therefore, if you can; do
what you can easily do without anxious exactness. Lay the foundation,
and leave the superstructure to posterity.” This is a very
interesting and remarkable letter, and exhibits Johnson as entirely
free from the vulgar anti-Celtic prejudices which long obtained in
many quarters after his day. It pointed to the lines of study which
the Celtic student should follow. But both Irish and Highland
scholars failed to comply with the lexicographer’s wishes. Philology
did not then exist, and accurate philosophical histories had
not then made much progress. Celtic scholars travelled to Spain
and Egypt and other places in the East for the cradle in which the
first pure Gaelic baby was rocked; linguistic affinities were sought
in Hebrew and Arabic; while Gaelic or Celtic was sometimes declared
to be the mother of all languages. This race of Gaelic Orientals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
continued to exist till recently, if indeed it is even now
wholly extinct. The Irish, however, at last have abundantly shown
the great extent of literature, manuscript and printed, which is enshrined
in their language. The recent works of learned Irishmen
are evidence that the interest is not abating in Irish literature.
While it is admitted that the Irish Gael is in possession of some
literature, it is yet denied that the Scottish Gael has any literary
remains to show. And indeed, looking at the barrenness of the
Highland hills, and the bareness of the Highland glens, the
stranger from the sunnier South is apt to think that no literature
could flourish on so sterile a soil. The lakes and straths, swept by
the fresh breezes, he feels too coldly uncongenial—too frigid a
home for the cultivation of letters—too dreary a land for the
muses to dwell in. Men of stout arms and lion hearts have issued
from these regions. That fact is recognised. But it is not well
known that also there, far from what have hitherto been regarded
as the great civilising centres, letters and knowledge have had for
ages their sacred precincts and earnest votaries. Unpromising
though the Highlands look to the literary eye, yet we find that
even Dr Samuel Johnson, no lover of either Celts or Scotsmen,
touches with pathetic beauty in two or three sentences written
upwards of a century ago, on the conditions under which, even in
the heart of the Highlands and Isles, in times of old, the production
of Gaelic literature was possible: “We are now treading
that illustrious island which was once the luminary of the Caledonian
regions, whence savage clans and roving barbarians derived
the benefits of knowledge and the blessings of religion. Far from
me and from my friends be such a frigid philosophy as may conduct
us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been
dignified by wisdom, bravery, or virtue. That man is not to be
envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of
Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the
ruins of Iona.” Dr Macculloch, again, speaks of our country as
owing a “deep debt of civilisation, of letters, and of religion” to
the same place. From that little isle, lying grandly with its white
brows of sand on the bosom of the mighty Atlantic, learned men
went forth twelve and thirteen hundred years ago to Ireland, to
England, and to many places on the Continent of Europe, to found
colleges and establish churches. Adamnan and Bede testify that
at that period Gaelic and Latin learning was cultivated in “the
Celtic colleges of Iona, Oransay, Ardchattan, Uist, Rowdill, and
Melrose,” and then and subsequently also in a score of other
academic centres of Gaelic learning and activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>Towards the close of the eighteenth century, when translations
of Gaelic poetry brought the genius of the Celtic spirit in contact
with the intellectual forces of modern Europe, many who hitherto
despised our Gaelic literature, began to look into this neglected
field. Lord Bute, a Scot, with Gaelic sympathies, was Prime Minister
then. The extract to be immediately given from a letter by
the distinguished Lord Bannatyne, who, as Sheriff of Bute, and
subsequently as Judge on Circuit at Inveraray, became interested
in Gaelic manuscripts, will show the attention bestowed on the subject
by men of position. Lord Bannatyne used his influence to
get the valuable Gaelic manuscripts of Major Maclachlan of Kilbride
in Argyllshire transferred to the Highland Society, and in
writing on the subject says:—“The result, you know, was, that
by means of the Rev. Francis Stuart, minister of Craignish, I obtained
confirmation of the fact that his family had once possessed
a very large collection, of which he had given two or three to General
Sir Adolphus Oughton and the late Sir James Foulis, both of
whom were Gaelic scholars, and that there still remained above
twenty in his possession.” Elsewhere we come across these and
other titled gentlemen acquiring knowledge of Gaelic over a hundred
years ago. It was the Earl of Eglintoun, with the approbation
of Boswell and Johnson, that inspired the publication of the <cite>Gaelic
Analysis</cite> by Shaw, who describes the acquisition of the language
late in life by Sir James Foulis in the following terms:—“who, late
in advanced years, has learned to read and write it, and now drinks
of the Pierian spring untainted by reading fragments of poetry in
Fingal’s own language.” Shaw was delighted with the patronage
which his aristocratic friends bestowed on Gaelic. The following
verses, translated by Sir James, found a place in his <span class="nowrap">Grammar:—</span></p>

<p>The subject of the ancient hymns and religious poetry of the
ancient Gaels was discussed in earlier chapters, as also the religious
compositions of mediæval times. After the stormy era of the
Reformation and the Jacobite period, the sacred muse of the
Highlands began to make her voice heard once more. The
sacred bards of the Early and Mediæval times have thus received
attention; it now remains to treat of those of Modern days.
The light of the Reformation movement failed for some generations
to reach the masses of the people in many districts of the
Highlands. The hindrances were many: the want of suitable
earnest pastors, and the large extent of the districts assigned to
each. It ought also to be remembered that the complete translation
of the Bible into Gaelic is not yet a century old; and even
although there had been a translation earlier there were not many
who were able to read it. The Highlanders then were also in the
first stages of a transition state. They felt the system of clanship
crumbling under their feet. Quarrels were easily fomented. The
strong and sagacious took advantage of the times, and took care to
adjust themselves to the developing circumstances of the future.
Jacobitism found a strong-hold in the Highlands, not because the
people were Papists or religiously indifferent or fervent lovers of
the Stuarts, but because they had a strong sense of justice and
loyalty, sore as they had frequently suffered for their fidelity.
Jacobite adventurers regarded the Highlands and Islands as a
suitable field for their treasonable operations—isolated from the
mighty stirring current of the kindling spirit of the times—a spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
that began to question the right divine of kings to govern wrong.
The conflict between the enlightened Protestant mind and the enslaving
spirit of Jacobitism came to an end on Culloden Moor.
Many of the Highlanders forsook the Stuart cause earlier. Argyllshire
in the west, and almost whole counties in the north and
north-east, did not either stir for Prince Charles or espoused the
opposite side. Evangelical religion had turned the current of the
people’s thoughts in those districts. Especially was this the case
in the north, where able and godly ministers—some of them
Lowland ministers, who found asylum there from persecution—brought
back the clans to the knowledge of the true religion.</p>

<p>Yet even in the north there were many inaccessible glens and
corners where many—often desperate men—made for themselves
a home, and where they lived in a state of heathenism. And in
this state they continued almost down to our own time. Uncomplimentary
as they were in many respects to the religious character
of his countrymen, there is no doubt the following lines were
very applicable last century. The author—Dr Macgregor, the
Gaelic apostle of Nova Scotia—laments that the Highlanders were
ignorant and blind, and that learning was rare among <span class="nowrap">them:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="gd">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Bha na Gaidhil ro aineolach dhall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bha ionnsachadh gann nam measg:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bha ’n eòlas co tana ’s co mall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’S nach b’aithne dhaibh ’n call a mheas.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ri bannsaibh, ’s ri ceòl da’n cluais.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1 noindent">This description of Macgregor was perfectly true, and applicable
to the Highlanders at the close of the great Jacobite struggle—so
absorbed were Highland energies with the social and political
enterprises of that disastrous period that the education and religious
training of the people were quite neglected. At the same
time there were many quiet corners north and south in which the
Gospel muse found an asylum, and one of these we find in Glendaruel,
Argyllshire, a spot closely associated with the early Celtic
romances and our ancient Gaelic manuscripts.</p>


<h3>DAVID MACKELLAR.</h3>

<p>The date of this author’s birth is unknown, but he appears to
have flourished in Glendaruel early in the eighteenth century.
Among the traditions preserved of him is the account that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
blind, and that after the celebrated Hymn or Holy Lay associated
with his name was composed, his sight was restored.</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Laoidh Mhic-Ealair</i>, or Mackellar’s Hymn, was greatly prized
among religious people, and became very popular before Buchanan
began to tune his sacred lyre in Rannoch. His fame rests chiefly
on this one production, although it is declared that in his youth
he indulged in the composition of profane pieces. According to
Reid, his hymn was first published in Glasgow about the year 1750.
It had, however, an earlier publication among the people through
many persons that learned it by heart and loved to repeat it on
account of its helpful statements of Gospel truths. It consists of
thirty-three stanzas or quatrains, and furnishes a Scriptural exposition
of the theme he took up. The date of his death is as uncertain
as that of his birth, but one authority tells us that a
granddaughter of his lived in Glasgow in the second quarter of
this century. The following verses remind us of the manner
of Buchanan, in whom we detect traces of Mackellar’s <span class="nowrap">muse:—</span></p>

<h3>JOHN MACKAY.</h3>

<p>This sacred bard is supposed to have been born about 1690,
and has been described as “a poet, a scholar, and a gentleman,”
and as of Mudale, parish of Farr, Sutherlandshire. He belonged
to the Clan-Abrach Mackays. A son of his, William, married and
resided at Knockfin, in the parish of Kildonan, and is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
been a contemporary of Rob Donn Mackay. He was a man of
deep religious spirit; and attained considerable local distinction
among the people of his district on account of the saintliness of his
character. In his “Metrical Reliques” John Rose describes
Mackay as “an eminently pious man,” and gives the following
account of the conditions under which one of the poems was composed:
“The first of these poems was composed by him on a fine
moonlight night in harvest while he happened to be out in the
fields, lying on his back, contemplating the glory and majesty of
the heavenly luminaries.”</p>

<p>Some men of the Sutherlandshire Militia stationed in 1746 at
Dunkeld, immediately after the Rebellion, are represented as pious
soldiers, who, having sought out Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch,
used to sing to him the religious poems of Mackay of Mudale.
The Sutherlandshire men used to relate that Buchanan sang
Mackay’s hymns “with great glee,” and that it was the latter’s
compositions that moved the former to sing in sacred strains himself.
There is probably little or no foundation for this last statement.
Mackellar had far more influence on Buchanan’s mind
than Mackay; but at the same time the story of the “Men” of
the far north is very instructive as indicating how readily men of
Evangelical sympathies and genuine Christian life understood one
another.</p>

<p>Five of Mackay’s compositions are preserved in Rose’s collection.
They are fair expositions of the pulpit themes with which
the “Men” of the north in those days were familiar, and appear
to have been well appreciated by the author’s religious <a id="tn-239">contemporaries,
by</a> whom they were orally preserved. The last, from
which the following two verses are taken, is composed in a simple
easy measure, and is entitled “<cite>The Complaint</cite>” in which we have
early indications of that Christian experience,—of the painful self-analysis
and introspection,—for which the “Men” subsequently
became so <span class="nowrap">remarkable:—</span></p>

<h3>DONALD MATHESON.</h3>

<p>Matheson, a sacred bard of considerable originality and spiritual
insight, was born in the parish of Kildonan, Sutherlandshire,
in 1719. At that time there was much religious fervour and feeling
in that part of the country as well as throughout the north in
general. So the “Sacred Poetry of the North” towards the end
of last century makes a pretty large volume. While Buchanan
was tuning his sacred harp in the central Highlands, Matheson
began his religious strains in the far north. Matheson cultivated
a small farm, and lived to the age of sixty-three, his death taking
place in 1782. He exercised great religious influence in his own
parish—his power of satire contributing much towards this influence.
A single poem of his was declared by the parish minister
to have done more good than all his own preaching for a series of
years. As a poet he stands as high as his countryman Rob Donn,
with whom he has many points in common, although Matheson’s
poetry <a id="tn-240">is decidedly sacred</a>, which Rob Donn’s is as decidedly not.
His Gaelic is frequently unintelligible to the western and southern
Gael, which is one reason why his poems have not been in greater
request among them. The following verse shows his manner in
<span class="nowrap">Gaelic:—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When Matheson’s Poems were first published early in this century,
they were accompanied with a preface from the hands of the
Rev. Dr Macdonald of Ferintosh and the Rev. John Kennedy of
Killearnan, in which the natural gifts of the poet, and his great
Christian graces are referred to in very high terms: “Though
destitute of the advantages of education,” say the writers of the
joint preface, “he was one of the most celebrated Christians in
that or perhaps any other country. He possessed a clear and
comprehensive view of Divine truth, and discovered a deep and
practical experience of its power on the heart and life.” In the
imperfect sketches of Matheson’s life which have been preserved
there are strong indications of the religious and ecclesiastical discontent
which prevailed among the laity in those northern districts
at the time, and of the latent dissent which subsequently developed.
It is interesting to read that “at one time the parish church
being vacant, Matheson headed a deputation from the people to
their Presbytery in quest of a minister. Finding the Presbytery
stiff to move, ‘I could sooner accomplish my errand with the
great Hearer of prayer,’ he said, ‘than with the Presbytery.’
One member, a clergyman of the unmitigated old Moderate
school, or as our Anglican friends would express it, of the extreme
High Church party, ridiculed him as not possessed of education or
influence entitling him to be heard. ‘You may mock,’ he replied,
but I can tell you the word of Scripture by which the Lord first
wounded my conscience. I can also tell the word by which
Christ was made precious to my soul;—I suspect that is more
than <em>you</em>, sir, can say.’” If poor Burns had been fortunate
enough to have a little of this spirit his contact with the graceless
members of the Presbytery of Ayr might have had a happier issue
for himself.</p>

<p>There were clergymen of considerable culture in Caithness and
Sutherland in the days of Matheson. Interesting sketches of some
of them will be found in local religious histories such as Auld’s
“Ministers and Men in the Far North.” Kennedy’s “Days of the
Fathers in Ross-shire” is another pleasant, gossipy work, in which
the struggle of light with darkness is vividly pourtrayed. At the
same time there were many spots in the central and western Highlands
where the truths of Christianity were scarcely known. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
these places was Abriachan, on the north-west bank of the
romantic Lochness, some ten miles west of Inverness. To this
day it is difficult of access, notwithstanding the recently well-made
winding road from the level of the loch to the villages. It
is a wild and barren-like gorge, surrounded east and west by hills
of a similar character. To the north lies a dreary moor, which
declines in the direction of Beauly.</p>

<p>The character and habits of the people at the beginning of the
eighteenth century harmonised well with the nature of the place
where they fixed their habitations. From this rather inaccessible
nest they carried on for years with impunity a regular system of
smuggling. They had every natural advantage on their side; they
were reluctant to give up a profitable though nefarious traffic, with
the lawfulness of which their consciences were not much concerned;
and so hitherto they had refused to submit themselves to
the more civilised conditions under which the people around them
began to settle. This was the sphere of labour assigned by the
Society in Scotland for Promoting Christian Knowledge to the
poet-evangelist MacLauchlan, who was virtually the first to preach
the Gospel to the people of Abriachan.</p>


<h3>LAUCHLAN MACLAUCHLAN.</h3>

<p>This bard-evangelist was born about the year 1729. He came
of a family who occupied for generations a portion of the farm of
Kinmylies, called Balmaclauchlan, near the town of Inverness.
He was about sixteen years of age when the Rebellion of 1745
broke out, and remembered well seeing the wretched fugitives
from that disastrous field of battle being cut down in their flight by
the English soldiery. While quite a young man he was selected
by the society already mentioned to be one of their evangelist-teachers
at Culduthel, some three miles from Inverness. After a
few years of successful labour there he was sent to Abriachan,
where by the weight and general excellence of his character and
the judicious exercise of his talents, the people soon became
quite transformed. It is said that the godly people of the district
used to travel ten and even twenty miles to hear the bard MacLauchlan
exhort. He was twice married, but had no family by
his first wife. In his second wife he found a truly congenial companion.
While he was an admirer of the famous Hector Macphail,
minister of Resolis, she was equally devoted to the no less famous
James Calder, minister of Croy, the two being, along with Mr<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
Alexander Fraser of Kirkhill, the most eminent ministers in the
north at that time. The poet died in the year 1801, and his
remains lie interred in the churchyard of Kirkhill. MacLauchlan
was evidently a remarkable man in his day, and appears to have
possessed very fair culture. An English letter of his addressed to
his son, a divinity student, afterwards the Rev. James MacLauchlan
of Moy, shows how well he could write English, and
how well versed he had been in evangelical theology—“I say
when two things are awanting, to go along with either the
doctrines of law or gospel has little or no effect; <em>i.e.</em>, when
either wants a homely or particular application. It may be sound
morality or sound gospel (even when both differ), yet so general
that attentive hearers may hear, and never be made to cry out,
<em>What shall we do to be saved?</em> Secondly, when law or gospel is
not attended with the operation of the Spirit of Christ, what can
be expected to be the consequence?... There is no wind so
proper to winnow Christ’s corn as that of the gospel.... I
might say a great deal on this subject, but one thing I find is,
when some would maintain that never man spake like this Man,
yet when Christ would address Himself with particular homeliness
the very same lips would cry out, <em>Crucify Him! Crucify Him!</em>
And this is come on the Church of Scotland, that she is now filled
with a silly general strain of preaching when and where soundest
fearing if truth is told so homely as to say like Nathan to David
‘Thou art the man,’ the speaker would become a prey; and if
such is the case with such as can preach orthodox law and gospel,
what can be said of such as can but lecture out harangues that are
neither true morality nor gospel?... I think some, and no
small part, of the distinction between a picture and the real being
of grace is first in the begetting, next in the birth, then in the feeding,
next in the growth, &amp;c.” This letter, like his poetry, shows
what a keen insight into human nature the bard possessed, and
how well he understood the causes of the religious deadness of his
day throughout the Church of Scotland. The poet makes here
the “silly general strain of preaching” the cause of this deadness;
elsewhere, in one of his poems he attributes the sad state of
things in the Church to patronage. He was right in both cases.
It was the patron that forced on the people preachers of the “silly
general strain” stamp. The revival of religion in the first quarter
of this century owes much to the good seed sowed by such earnest,
faithful men, as MacLauchlan; and not a few of our ablest ministers
of the present day have descended from such worthy ancestry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
The late Rev. Dr Thomas MacLauchlan of Edinburgh, the eminent
Celtic scholar and eloquent preacher, was a grandson of the
poet-evangelist of Abriachan; and one of the doctor’s sons, Hugh,
is possessed of poetical endowments and literary talents worthy
of his great-grandfather.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to give satisfactory translations of any poetry,
but Gaelic measures and turns of expression present peculiar difficulties.
I have endeavoured in what follows to give renderings of
some verses of all the poems of MacLauchlan that have come
down to us. The longest is the “Elegy” on Macphail of
Resolis; but much of his poetry is said to have been lost. After
committing several of his poems to writing, the author, forming
but a low estimate of his own abilities, committed the MS. to the
flames.</p>

<p>We first give a few verses of the “Elegy” above referred to,
although it cannot be said to be the best specimen of the poet’s
<span class="nowrap">productions—</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the “Elegy” we find several good verses bearing on the subject
of patronage in the Church of Scotland. They show us how galling
that yoke of Parliament was always felt to be; and how clearly
Bible-cultured people, of no pretence to a knowledge of the mysteries
of statecraft, discern the radical ills by which communities
and individuals are fatally afflicted. It was only in 1874 that
statesmen legislatively acknowledged the evils which were so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
patent to the poetic eye of MacLauchlan of Abriachan a century
<span class="nowrap">before:—</span></p>


<p class="p1 center fs80">PATRONAGE.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Her true-soul’d witnesses are rare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gospel now so few declare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our secret griefs we cease to hide</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Though Patronage had her interred,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like Lazarus unsepulchered,—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The Patron’s power disappears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we’ll have praise instead of tears.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The “State of the World,” or the worldly, is another poem of
considerable merit. It not unlikely represents much of the style
of thinking and manner of the bard in his preaching addresses.
Indeed our religious bards in general give us a good deal of general
preaching and exhortation in their productions. Buchanan
has done so; so has Macgregor; while Grant’s hymns, as well as
those of Dr Macdonald, are very much evangelical sermons in
verse. The following translation is as literal as the exigencies of
rhyme and metre can <span class="nowrap">admit:—</span></p>

<p>There are eight lines of a little poem called “<span lang="gd">An Samhla,</span>” or
<cite>The Comparison</cite>, which reminds us of the generally subjective
state of mind which the Highland men were wont to cultivate so
assiduously. In Morrison of Harris and in Macrae of Petty we
see the extreme spiritual self-analysis which they carried on. I

<p>Though MacLauchlan has not left much to prove that he possessed
the gift of satire, yet it seems that some of his poems helped
his preaching considerably in extirpating the habit of card-playing
once so universal in the Highlands—it used to be carried on at
baptisms, weddings, and even late wakes. Highlanders have had
a terrible dread of being satirised by the bards. To have come
under the satiric tongue of the poet acted like a social excommunication;
and bards frequently availed themselves of this power to
accomplish ends different from that to which MacLauchlan had
set himself in the following <span class="nowrap">verses:—</span></p>

<p>MacLauchlan’s poems have been considered at greater length
than the mere quality of his poetry might warrant because they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
shed light on the life and manners of the Highlanders during a
particular time in a circumscribed district, and because hitherto
they, in common with those of several other religious bards, have
received no attention whatever. On the other hand, the great
bards of the secular life have been very abundantly written upon
and their merits exhibited.</p>


<h3>DUGALD BUCHANAN.</h3>

<p>The Highlands produced several religious poets of considerable
merit during the eighteenth century, although the areas of
living religious activities were undoubtedly very limited. Chief
among them was Dugald Buchanan, whose hymns have taken
a very high place. He has been compared to Cowper, but he
reminds us more of the celebrated Welsh bard Goronwy Owen,
who has much in common with Buchanan. It is curiously suggestive
that the sacred bard of Anglesea and the sacred bard of
Rannoch, the religious representative poets of their respective
countries, should be found composing highly spiritual poems, and
at the same period writing elaborate ones on the awful theme of
the “Day of Judgment,” while the polished Addison and ethical
Johnson were delivering their well-finished articles on mere moral
platitudes to a highly conventional generation. Perhaps the
Highlanders have received, apart from the Bible, no greater gift
than the holy and sublime strains of the muse of Buchanan, who
impressed his personality and character on all the Gaelic-speaking
portion of his countrymen who in his days were in the throes of
painful political changes, and about to enter on a new era of
severe trial and uncertainty. Much of what the world has admired
in the Highland character since is due to the formative and
healthy influence of Dugald Buchanan’s hymns.</p>

<p>Dugald Buchanan was born in 1716 on the farm of Ardoch,
Perthshire, where his father rented a farm and was the owner of a
small meal mill the remains of which are still standing. His
people were deeply religious people, of whom he speaks with
much affection and respect in the autobiographical sketch which
he left written in English. It is remarkable to find such people in
Balquidder at that period—in the country of Rob Roy, who the
year before the poet was born had marshalled his men on the field
of Sheriffmuir under the banner of the Pretender.</p>

<p>Young Buchanan was educated in one of the schools belonging
to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
formed in 1701. There he received a good education, which was
afterwards supplemented by attendance on some classes in Edinburgh
University, while he was superintending the printing of the
Gaelic New Testament. And this last fact reminds me that I
have recently counted more than twenty well-known Gaelic bards
who received University education; so the general cry of illiteracy
is not applicable to the majority of them who at least were
trained in the rudiments of learning.</p>

<p>Buchanan was afterwards appointed by the Presbytery of the
bounds to be catechist and evangelist in the district of Rannoch,
where he laboured with much acceptance and success. He died
of virulent fever in June 1768, when he was fifty-two years of
age. His death was profoundly mourned by every family in the
district. His widow survived till 1824, and one of his daughters
died as recently as 1854.</p>

<p>It is said that Buchanan composed a good deal of poetry
that has never been published. He published his religious poems
or hymns in 1767. They are eight in number, the longest,
“The Day of Judgment,” is 408 lines in length. This poem is also
his best. It is dramatically vivid and very sublime. Indeed,
Buchanan is the only Gaelic bard that exhibits much sublimity.
He was a man of culture, of even judgment, and of true insight
into human nature. There are many evidences of his acquaintance
with the literature of his own and other times. While he knew
something of Shakespeare and other masters of English literature,
he became especially a student of the living religious thought of the
England of his day. The writings of such men as Philip Doddridge
and Isaac Watts helped to feed his spiritual needs and to
colour the products of his own genius.</p>

<p>The works of Buchanan have maintained their popularity to the
present day. In 1875 the twenty-first edition of his poetry appeared,
accompanied by a new sketch of his life by the Rev.
Allan Sinclair, late Free Church minister of Kenmore. In November
of the same year, a monument, in the form of an obelisk
of Peterhead granite, was erected to commemorate his name and
genius at Kinloch-Rannoch.</p>

<p>The poems of Buchanan, in whole or in portions, have been
frequently brought before the English-speaking world. Macgregor,
Maclachlan of Canada, Pattison, Sinclair, Blackie, and
Macbean have attempted translations with varying successes. As
in the case of the finest lyrics on less sacred themes, the translation
of these hymns presents peculiar difficulties which can only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
be fairly overcome by translators whose own spirits are in holy
unison with the language and sentiments of the author. It is
quite evident that such a master-translator as Professor Blackie
cannot feel at home among religious truths and experiences, with
which his sympathies are not very warm. What Buchanan calls
“conversion” Blackie would describe as a new point of “ethical
departure,”—a cold and philosophical conception of an all-important
event which could scarcely charm the hearts of religious
folks of the poet’s type. Only the pens of a Mason Neale and
like-minded men can glide along sympathetically on these sacred
heights of holy thought and life.</p>

<p>The first of the hymns is called <cite>The Majesty of God</cite>, which
begins in octosyllabic verse as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O what is God! or what His name!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Angels in glory cannot know;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where he is veiled in dazzling light</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No thought or eye can ever go.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1 noindent">This is one of the less popular of his hymns, the theme being of
a more abstract nature than that on which he dwells generally.</p>

<p>The hymn which stands second in the order of publication is
called <cite>The Sufferings of Christ</cite>. This <a id="tn-250">beautiful production</a> has
greatly impressed Highland religious thought, and that before the
Gaelic Scriptures were yet entirely translated or in the hands of
the people. The form of verse chosen is very happy, and one
into which the Gaelic language flows with liquid ease and beauty.
Its spirit and manner may be imperfectly gathered from the following
<span class="nowrap">lines:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">It is my Saviour’s sufferings</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My song will now proclaim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That High King’s life of humbleness</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In birth and death of shame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The miracle most wonderful</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That e’er to men was told:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God who was from eternity—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">An infant born behold!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1 noindent">The poet then rehearses in tender and mellifluous strains the
more suggestive events of the Lord’s earthly life, and ends in a
few verses of extreme beauty, pathos, and simplicity, detailing
the agonizing circumstances of His death and crucifixion. The
air to which the hymn is usually sung is very pretty and plaintive,
and is a great favourite in the Highlands. At a time when living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
Gospel preaching was far from general, the rehearsal of this and
other similar productions on Sunday in many humble Highland
homes, helped to keep alive the flame of spiritual life.</p>

<p>The next is the greatest of his poems or hymns—<cite>The Day of
Judgment</cite>. The poet begins in his usual Scriptural simple style,
but as he proceeds the treatment and the language become elevated
and majestic. We seem to see the <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> acting
their gorgeous parts on the canvass of the poet’s grand conceptions.
The verses beginning with “<span lang="gd">’N sin fàsaidh rudhadh anns an
speur</span>,” are regarded as very sublime. But there is no translation
of this poem that will convey anything like a fair impression of
the original. The following verses may give some idea of the
manner of the <span class="nowrap">poem:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, like the morn enkindling red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A glowing spreads throughout the skies;</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The clouds all suddenly unfold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make for the High King a door;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we the Mighty Judge behold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose glory streams forth evermore.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The rainbow glows around his form,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His voice resounds like mountain-floods;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Outflashing o’er the sullen storm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His lightning eye pours from the clouds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun, great lustre of the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before His glorious Person pales;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At length her failing brightness dies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the light His face unveils.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Her robes of gloom she will uptake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blood-red moon drops down in space;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mighty heavenly powers shall shake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Outcasting planets from their place.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Like tempest-shaken fruit on trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shall they tremble in the skies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like heavy rain-drops on the breeze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their glory like a dead man’s eyes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The poetical conceptions of Buchanan on this subject have woven
themselves into the theological ideas of the Highlander, like those
of Milton into the religious thought of England.</p>

<p class="noindent">The poet, after this introduction, goes on to moralise at great
length, drawing his lessons from the seasons and their changes.
His poems are eight in number, and altogether constitute but a
very small volume.</p>

<p>The titles of the other poems not referred to above are—<cite>The
Dream</cite>, <cite>The Hero</cite>, and <cite>Prayer</cite>. An excellent sketch of his life and
conversion written by the author himself in good English, has been
translated into Gaelic, and is found frequently prefixed to the
Hymns. This <a id="tn-253">account the author</a> solemnly signs, and prays that
this transaction of his signing himself as the Lord’s consecrated
servant on earth may be ratified in heaven. Buchanan tells us
that he was an anxious hearer at one of the sermons which the
distinguished evangelist George Whitefield preached at Cambuslang
on the occasion of the latter’s visit to Scotland.</p>

<p>Buchanan, in conception and utterance, shows more than the other
Gaelic bards the effects of his acquaintance with English literature.
The religious subjects which were the theme of his poetry partially
account for this. When in Edinburgh Buchanan became acquainted
with several distinguished men in the Scottish capital—among
others, the celebrated David Hume, who was much impressed by
the culture and character of the Sacred Bard of Rannoch.</p>

</div>


<p>The authors whose works come under notice in this chapter
may be described as belonging to the Anglo-Gaelic era of Highland
history, when the influence of English thought, movements,
and manners began to penetrate into the most sequestered corners
of the north west. This influence came in through the two channels
of the religious literature of English Puritanism and Imperial
politics. When the Highlander came under the spell of the
former in such works as those of Bunyan, he no longer cherished
alien feelings towards Bunyan’s fellow-countrymen, many of whose
struggles and sufferings were akin to his own; nor did he want
any longer to nurse a spirit of mere Gaelic separatism that might
conflict with the national purposes of the latter. We, therefore,
find traces of English reading and culture in all the Gaelic poetry
that has been produced since the commencement of this era.
Even very early last century there is evidence that English
thought began to exercise some influence on the compositions of
the Highland poets. As already pointed out, English literature
contributed not a little to the development of Dugald Buchanan’s
sacred muse. The chief Gaelic poets of this period were fairly
well educated, and knew the English language well. Several of
them were clergymen who had gone through a course of training
in Scottish Universities.</p>

<p>There are three elements of sadness that enter into the poetry
of this period—first, the sorrowful cry of baffled Jacobitism;
second, the vain cry of enthusiasts over the disappearance of
Gaelic habits and customs; and again, the intense wail of a
fatherland spirit over the depopulation of the Highlands. Along
with greater devotion to the cultivation of erotic poetry these are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
the themes of the bards of this era, who feel painfully conscious
that the ground of this transition period is fast slipping away from
under their feet.</p>


<h3>ROBERT MACKAY.</h3>

<p>This famous Sutherlandshire Bard, better known as Rob Donn,
or Robert the Brown, was born in the parish of Durness in 1714.
He is said to have composed verses between his third and sixth
years, like some other poets, early lisping in numbers. For a
long time before his death he filled the humble office of principal
herd for his chief’s (Lord Reay) cattle. He died in 1778, when
he was sixty-four years of age. Although most of his pieces cannot
be said to be religious—some much the reverse—we are told
that he was an elder in the national Presbyterian Church. His
death was deeply regretted over the whole country, where his
memory is still most warmly cherished.</p>

<p>His poetical works were collected and edited early in this century
by the late Rev. Mackintosh Mackay, LL.D., who wrote a
memoir of the bard. Sir Walter Scott directed Lockhart to review
Mackay’s Poems eulogistically in <cite>The Quarterly Review</cite>,
giving him a place among the real sons of the muse. The monument
to his memory has inscriptions on it in Gaelic, Greek, and
Latin, so that Rob Donn has had fair justice done him.</p>

<p>Mackay wants imagination and the overpowering feeling we
find in two or three others of the Gaelic bards. But although he
does not stand among the very first of the Gaelic poets, he is yet a
powerful, refreshing, and influential singer, with a good deal of
wit, point, and satire. He is a shrewd and sensible man, with a
Wordsworthian tendency to exalt the commonplace into fit themes
for poetry.</p>

<p>His <cite>Elegy on Ewen</cite> is one of his best-known pieces. The
morning he composed it he heard of the death of Pelham, then
Prime Minister to King George the Second; and he contrasted
his death with the dying state of poor Ewen, in whose house he
had stayed the previous night. Ewen could not converse with
the bard, who, after kindling the fire in the morning for the
dying man, composed the poem from which the following stanzas
translated by a clansman of the bard—Mr Angus M. Mackay—are
<span class="nowrap">taken:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent4">Long time, O Ewen, &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This old beggar did not yet lose his power of hearing, and feeling
insulted by the manner in which his name was introduced into the
moralising verses he snatched up a club towards the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
song, and creeping behind the bard aimed a blow at him with all
the strength of his withered arm. Rob barely escaped, and tried
to soothe the enraged old man.</p>

<p>Mackay shows great detestation of greed in his poems. One is
a dialogue between the world and the greedy man. The wants of
the bard in his humble station were few and easily supplied, so he
could contemplate with sorrow the growing spirit of selfishness
that began to creep in along with advancing civilisation and
change of habit. This spirit he rebukes in the following verse
from an address to Lord <span class="nowrap">Reay:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hadst thou by nature been a man of greed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How soon had grown the tempting glittering hoard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou to pity’s tears hadst deigned no heed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hard-wrung rents with human curses stored!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But no, for when the yearly rents were paid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was more joy to thee a thousand-fold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see a glad face in God’s image made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than the king’s image on the yellow gold!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Like many of the bards, Rob appears to have suffered from a
sore affair of the heart. A yellow-haired Annie deceived him,
and ran away with a fair carpenter from the south, and he sang
<i lang="gd">Is trom leam an àiridh</i>. It seems the courting was carried on at
a shieling, a favourite place of resort for fond swains and tender
maidens:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, sad is the shieling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And gone are its joys!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All harsh and unfeeling</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To me now its noise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since Anna—who warbled</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As sweet as the merle—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forsook me—my honey-mouthed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Merry-lipped girl!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div><hr class="tb"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ach, ach, now I’m trying</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My loss to forget—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With sorrow and sighing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With anger and fret.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But still that sweet image</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Steals over my heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And still I deem fondly</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hope need not depart.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So fancy beguiles me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And fills me with glee,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the carpenter wiles thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">False speaker! from me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet from Love’s first affection</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I never get free;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the dear known direction</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My thoughts ever flee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The above verses are Pattison’s translation. It is said that the
deceitful “Anna” led an unhappy life afterwards, and never recovered
her old spirits after the memorable parting at the “shieling,”
of which the bard sings so pathetically.</p>

<p>While Rob Donn is not equal to Macdonald or Macintyre in
the highest qualifications of the poet, he is their superior in power
of satire. His two rival bards have confounded vituperative
language with satire, but Mackay never. He is a great favourite
with his countrymen, who are very proud of him, and have laudably
done all they could to make known his poetry and perpetuate
his fame.</p>

<p>In many respects Mackay is a typical representative of the
northern counties, where the intense Celtic spirit and feelings of
nationality which characterise Argyllshire Celts do not prevail so
extensively. The Teutonic element brought in by the Norse is
stronger in the North, and may partly account for this apparent
lack of Celtic enthusiasm and of the usual Celtic grace of style.
In his own way, though exercising his sportive muse in a more
confined and humbler sphere, Rob Donn might be described as a
sort of Highland Praed or Calverley.</p>

<p>The bard was in the service of two of his clan on whom he has
composed well-known elegies. These two were Lord Reay and
John Mackay. The elegy on the latter has been translated as
follows by the clansman already referred to in a good sketch
which appeared some years ago in a London <span class="nowrap">periodical:—</span></p>

<h3>DUNCAN MACINTYRE.</h3>

<p>This bard, Mac-an-t-Saoir—the Irish MacTear—meaning the
son of the joiner or carpenter, a recent intruder among the names
of the Gaelic clans, is one of the great Highland poets to whom
the Gaelic patriot refers with a pardonable measure of pride.
Ossian, Macdonald, and he are the chief names on the roll of our
bardic annals.</p>

<p>This famous hunter bard, frequently called Duncan <i lang="gd">Ban</i>, or
<em>fair-haired</em>, was born on the 20th of March 1724, at Druimliaghart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
in Glenorchay, Argyllshire. His parents lived in an
out-of-the-way spot, far from the parish school, so Duncan never
learned to read or write. Yet, rising from a humble sphere of
life, with only the education that the traditions, the popular
poetry and scenery of his native hills could afford, he has left us
compositions which we would not willingly allow to perish.
Highly cultivated some of his mental powers must have been.
His memory was something wonderful; and yet there have been
at all times in the Highlands men equally trained like Macintyre
to remember and rehearse thousands of lines of poetry. Upwards
of six thousand lines of poetry composed by himself have been
published. All this he carried about with him for years, along
with the poetry of others, an immense mass of which he knew
and was able to repeat, until the Rev. Dr Stewart of Luss, one of
the translators of the Bible, was at the trouble of taking them
down to the poet’s own dictation some time before 1768, when
they were first published in one 12mo volume of 162 pages. A
second edition appeared in 1799 and a third in 1804. These
were all the editions before his death took place in the year 1812.
But thousands knew them who never read them; while many of
his more popular pieces found their way into other Gaelic collections.
There have been several other editions since Macintyre
died.</p>

<p>The first song of Duncan Bàn was composed on a sword with
which he was armed at the Battle of Falkirk, where he served on
the Royalist side as a substitute for Mr Fletcher of Glenorchay.
The sword was lost or thrown away in the retreat, and his employer
refused to pay the sum for which he had engaged the bard.
But Duncan’s song became popular and incensed Fletcher so
much that, meeting the poor poet one day, he suddenly struck him
on the back with his walking-stick, and bade him “go and make
a song about that.” Macintyre appealed to his patron the Earl
of Breadalbane, who compelled Fletcher to pay the bard the
stipulated sum, 300 merks Scots (£16 17s 6d).</p>

<p>Soon after the noble Earl—always kind to the bard—appointed
him forester and gamekeeper in Coire Cheathaich and Ben-Dorain,
the subjects of his two chief and finest poems. He was afterwards
in the same capacity with the Duke of Argyll at Buachaill-Eite.
Then he joined the Fencible Regiment raised in 1793 by
the Earl of Breadalbane, where he served as a sergeant until
1799, when it was disbanded. He afterwards served in the City
Guard of Edinburgh till 1806, when he was enabled to live comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
on his own savings and on the profits of the third edition
of his poems. He died in Edinburgh in May 1812, in the 89th
year of his age, and was buried in the Greyfriars Churchyard,
where a monument has been raised for him.</p>

<p>Duncan Bàn, in some respects, is the first of the Gaelic bards;
Professor Blackie seems inclined to rank him above Ossian. He
is certainly less artificial than the Gaelic Ossian of 1807—more in
harmony with the life and sentiments of the Highlanders. He is
the natural outcome as well as the true exponent of the spirit and
manners of the period of Highland history which was then drawing
to a close. His powers as a poet are of the highest order.
But the sphere of his life being so circumscribed, and the themes
on which his muse was exercised were so temporary and local in
their character, that Duncan Bàn can never receive <a id="tn-261">from the
world</a> that homage to which his wonderful and lofty genius
entitles him. He has been called the Burns of the Highlands;
and, perhaps, his genius is equal to that of Burns, taking into
consideration the difference in their education. Burns, however,
shows more intensity of conception and stormy passion; while
Macintyre dwells with more luscious delight on the beauties and
glories of the external world.</p>

<p>Professor Blackie is a great admirer of Duncan Bàn, and
has given us what will always remain a delightful translation
of Macintyre’s unique poem, <cite lang="gd">Ben-Dorain</cite>. The translator of
Goethe’s “Faust”—whose new edition of his translation of the
great German bard’s work must ever be regarded as the best—possesses
the poetical ingenuity and subtilty, as well as deftness in
rhyme, necessary in a translator of <cite lang="gd">Ben-Dorain</cite>. <cite lang="gd">Coire Cheathaich</cite>
is a poem equally celebrated with <cite lang="gd">Ben-Dorain</cite>, translated into
English by Pattison, whose version has been utilized by Mr
Robert Buchanan, the distinguished dramatist and poet, with
slight alterations, in one of his works. Through these translators
the English reader is put in possession of some fair knowledge of
the muse of the Hunter-Bard of Glenorchay.</p>

<p>Here is the first verse of <cite lang="gd">Coire Cheathaich</cite>, or The Braes of the
<span class="nowrap">Mist:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">My misty Coire! where hinds are roving;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My lovely Coire! my charming dell!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So grand, so grassy, so richly scented,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And gemm’d with flowers of sweetest smell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy knolls and hillocks in dark-green clothing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rise o’er the green sward with gentle swell,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where waves the cannach, and grows the darnel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And troop the wild deer I love so well.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Duncan’s chief love-song is characteristic. It is composed for
his “spouse newly wedded” and not for an unmarried maiden.
This is how the bard describes the manner in which he made
choice of “Fair Young <span class="nowrap">Mary”:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">My net I cast in the waters clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And strained hard to draw it to land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo! I had caught a <a id="tn-262">bright sea-trout</a>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That lay like a swan on the strand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pleased was my soul with the fortune</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That came with such joy to my hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My spouse! thou art the star of the morning!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Blest be thy slumbers and bland!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Aged and grey” he visited the hills for the last time, and
composed his “Last Farewell to the Hills,” one of the most
pathetic of his poems. Taking a retrospect of the past, he sorrowfully
<span class="nowrap">sings:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And yesterday I trode yon moor—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How many a thought it moved!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The friends I walked with there of yore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where were those friends I loved!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I looked and looked, <em>and sheep, sheep still</em>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Were all that I could see:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A change had struck the very hill—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">O world! deceiving me.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Few descriptive poets excel Macintyre in his representations of
external things, whether animate or inanimate. Everything he
touches he invests with the glow and the beauty of poetry. The
hills with their mist and deer, the streams and lochs with their
teeming inhabitants, and all the natural inhabitants of his native
glens and mountains, were congenial themes of his muse. “His
Address to his wife—Mairi Bhan Og—may be read beside the
sweetest and most expressive of the Lowland lyrics, while it certainly
breathes a refined courtesy and a purity of sentiment which
these do not always possess, and which is not in any way insignificant
in such a man, whether taken as an index of his moral
nature, of his intellectual endowments, or of the kindliness of
nature in gifting him with such unaffected manliness and good
taste.” Macdonald could be sweet and tender when he chose;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
it was far from being his nature. Macintyre is generally genial
and tender, for it is the habitual attitude of his mind and heart.
We are told “he was like the rest of the poets, <a id="tn-263">very fond of</a> company
and a social glass, and was not only very pleasant over his
bottle, but very circumspect.”</p>

<p>I give here a specimen of his poem, <cite lang="gd">Ben-Dorain</cite>, of which
we have a translation from the pen of Professor <span class="nowrap">Blackie:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Where the deer in airy state</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Wont to go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At least a hundred brace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the lofty antlered race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When they left their sleeping-place</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Light and gay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When they stood in trim array,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with low deep-breasted cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flung their breath into the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">From the brae:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the hind, the pretty fool,</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">On the hill.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sweeter to my ear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is the concert of the deer</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">In their roaring;</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">Of a bride.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The number and variety of Macintyre’s compositions is very
large, all sorts of themes being regarded as fit for the exercise of
his poetic fancy. Like those of the Highland bards, however,
his subjects are generally more of local and personal than of the
larger human interests—a fact which is not at all surprising when
his education, calling, circumstances, and surroundings are considered.</p>

<p>Personal satires and eulogies, as well as the ordinary events
of Highland humble life and occupations, form the circle of
themes with which his muse is occupied. But wherever he gets the
opportunity of seizing upon new subjects he straightway rushes at
them, and turns them over in the rural though rich alembic of his
intellectual and ethical processes, with results which show shrewdness,
sagacity, and poetic powers of observation of a high order.
In the corrie, on the hillside, or after the chase, Duncan Bàn is at
home, and his poetry then rises to the highest pitch of the true
pastoral. Elsewhere his muse necessarily travels on lower planes.
But, like all his countrymen, inspired by visions of the great bens
and far-reaching valleys, he is ever eager to extend his sphere
of observation as well as his horizon of knowledge.</p>

<p>In his suggestive poem in <cite>Praise of Dunedin</cite>, or of Edinburgh,
where the patriarchal poet died at the good age of eighty-nine,
there is a current of pleasant and pawky observation which reminds
us of the great changes that have come over the Scottish
capital as over <cite lang="gd">Ben-Dorain</cite> of the poet’s “Farewell.” The following
verses of a very literal rendering describes the author’s
impressions of what usually attracted his gaze in “Bonnie
<span class="nowrap">Dunedin”:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is difficult to say how far the recovery of the regalia, her

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our Alba wants the Crown”—</div>

<p class="noindent">but undoubtedly in these days of gas illuminations and electric-light

no “cause of pleasure” to the most unsophisticated son of the

</div>

<p>Contemporary with <a id="tn-267">and immediately</a> after the great singers
Macdonald, Mackay, and Macintyre were many other bards
whose inspiration is clearly traceable to their era. Some of them
composed very largely, although in many cases not more than
one or two of their compositions are remembered. Many of the
composers were well educated, and had they written in a language
better understood in the world in general, their names would have
been better known. The present Highlanders, while frequently
singing their songs, do not know so much as the <a id="tn-267a">names of the
authors</a>. The same may be said also of Lowlanders with regard
to many of their own songs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ronald Macdonald.</span>—The merits of this bard were overshadowed
by the great fame of his father, <i lang="gd">Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair</i>.
He was a man of considerable attainments and of undoubted
poetic gifts, and published a selection of his own and
his father’s poems in 1775. He was to publish more, but did not
meet with suitable encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lachlan Macpherson.</span>—This writer, probably better known
as “Strathmasie,” his territorial designation, and described as
a gentleman and a scholar, was born about the year 1723, and
died in 1767. He gave able assistance to James Macpherson of
Ossianic fame in his translations. The relation of Strathmasie to
the work has been a subject of very acrid discussion. His own
acknowledged poems are in good idiomatic Gaelic, and in style
and metre are quite different from the Gaelic poems of James
Macpherson’s Ossian, but quite like the poetry of the other
Gaelic bards. In all his published poems there is not a stanza or
even a line <i lang="fr">a la</i> Ossian. In poetic power and originality he is
much behind Duncan Bàn and <i lang="gd">Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair</i>, but he
has shown that he is quite able to write tolerable poetry. The
titles of his poems are—<cite>An Elegy on Cluny</cite>; <cite>The Fellowship of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Usquebay</cite>; <cite>A Marriage</cite>; <cite>The Dun Breeks</cite>; <cite>A Hunting Song</cite>; <cite>The
Advice</cite>; <cite>An Amorous Piece</cite>; <cite>Satire on Mice</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Roy Stuart.</span>—Colonel Stuart was a native of Kincardine
in Badenoch. He first served in the French army against
the British Government. He was afterwards with Prince Charles
on the fatal moor of Culloden. After lurking for some time in
this country he managed to escape to France, where he died.
His signal bravery at Culloden was observed by the Duke of
Cumberland, who asked who he was: “Ah, that is John Roy
Stuart.” “Good God!” exclaimed the Duke, “the man I left
in Flanders doing the butcheries of ten heroes! Is it possible
that he could have dogged me here!” Stuart’s Poems—the
principal of them is on <cite>Culloden Day</cite>—are impetuous, racy, and
vigorous. An English bit of humorous verses, called <cite>Roy Stuart’s
Psalm</cite>, extemporised where he was hiding on one occasion, runs
<span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lord’s my targe, I will be stout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With dirk and trusty blade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though Campbells come in flocks about,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I will not be afraid.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lord’s the same as heretofore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He’s always good to me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though red-coats come a thousand more</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Afraid I will not be.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Kenneth Mackenzie.</span>—This bard was born in 1758 at <i lang="gd">Caisteal
Leahuir</i>, near Inverness. When quite a young man he went to
sea, but returned in 1789, when he began to collect subscribers’
names for his proposed volume of poetry. Some time after the
publication of his poems he was procured the rank of an officer in
the 78th Highlanders, through the joint influence of Lords Seaforth
and Buchan. After leaving the army he got the situation of
postmaster in an Irish provincial town. He was living in 1837.
His poems are of an high order, polished, smooth, and well-finished.
One of his songs has become a universal favourite—<cite lang="gd">Am
Féile Preasach</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allan Macdougall.</span>—This highly popular bard, better known
as <i lang="gd">Ailein Dall</i>, or Blind Allan, was born in Glencoe in 1750.
His parents were poor, so Allan, incapacitated by his infirmity of
blindness for the usual spheres of industry, turned his attention to
music as a means of livelihood. He soon became well known as
a fiddler in the district, and by engagements at country weddings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
and raffles earned a little to support himself. The poems
also he composed helped to make him popular; and with the assistance
of Mr E. MacLachlan, latterly of Aberdeen, who was
then a tutor in the neighbourhood, a volume was prepared and
published. Soon after this Colonel Ronaldson Macdonald of
Glengarry took the poet under his patronage. In 1828 he travelled
the counties of Argyll, Ross, and Inverness for subscribers
for a new edition of his poems, but after procuring 1000 names,
and going to press in 1829, the poor poet died. He was buried
in the churchyard of Kilfinan. He has been regarded as the last
of the family bards. He was a man of true poetic gifts; <a id="tn-269">many of
his songs</a> are still highly popular, such <span class="nowrap">as—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="gd">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nam faighainn gille r’a cheannach.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">James Shaw.</span>—Poor James Shaw, otherwise called <i lang="gd">Bard Lochuan-Eala</i>,
was born about 1758. He subsequently lived at Ardchattan,
where he received some kindness from General Campbell
and his lady. He died in 1828 suddenly on board a steamboat
when returning from Glasgow, where he was trying to get his
poems printed. He has been described as idle and dissipated.
<i lang="gd">Bidh Fonn Oirre Daonnan</i>, one of his songs, is still very popular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Donald Macdonald.</span>—Like the Bard of Lochnell this composer
too fell a victim to his own infirmities of character. Macdonald,
also called <i lang="gd">Am Bard Conanach</i>, was born in 1780 in
Strathconon, Ross-shire. He was a sawyer by trade, which he
pursued after he removed to Inverness, where he did not fail to
give scope to his convivial disposition. His moral conceptions of
things do not seem to have been of a very high order, judging by
his well-known song <i lang="gd">Fhuair me Sgeula moch an dè</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander MacKinnon.</span>—This composer, whose father was a
farmer in Morar, Arisaig, was born in 1770. Early in life he enlisted
in the 92nd Regiment, and was present at the Battle of
Alexandria in 1801, where he was wounded. He was discharged,
and enjoyed his pension for some time; but disliking the quietness
of civilian life, he again joined the army, where he remained
till he died at Fort-William in 1814. His principal poems are on
<cite>Landing in Egypt</cite>, <cite>The Battle of Egypt</cite>, and <cite>The Battle of Holland</cite>.
These are characterised by much poetic fire and warlike
enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angus Fletcher.</span>—This gentle and cultured bard, the author<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
of the highly popular production <i lang="gd">Clachan ghlinn Daruadhail</i>, was
born on the west bank of Loch Eck, in Cowal, 1776. He was
educated at the parish school of Kilmodan. Afterwards he lived
for some time in Bute, <a id="tn-270">till he became</a>, in 1804, parochial schoolmaster
of Dunoon. He is also the author of some other songs
that have become popular, especially <cite>The Lassie of the Glen</cite>,
which, in an English dress from Fletcher’s own pen, is well-known.
This song was first published in the “Edinburgh Weekly
Journal.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allan Macintyre.</span>—Very few Highlanders have ever heard of
this author. Macintyre, known as <i lang="gd">Ailein nan Sionach</i>, or fox-hunting
Allan, was a native of Kintyre. He published early in
the century a small volume of his own, and other poems, but few
of his productions are now sung, and his book is rather scarce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Donald MacLeod.</span>—This author published while he was
still young a volume of original and other poems in 1811. Young
of Inverness was the publisher, and probably he and others influenced
the young author in his selection of such pieces of questionable
taste and authorship as those of the <cite lang="gd">Ceisteir Crubach</cite> and
<cite lang="gd">Mordubh</cite>. MacLeod’s productions are rated very highly by his
countrymen who delight in designating him, <i lang="gd">Am Bard Sgiathanach</i>,
or The Skye Bard. While Macleod is undoubtedly a man of good
poetic parts, he ranks much below his far more distinguished and
gifted son, Neil Macleod, whose songs have deservedly taken a
high place in popular esteem.</p>


<p class="p1">Other bards of various gifts, and authors of published volumes
of poetry during this period, <span class="nowrap">are—</span></p>

<p><em>Duncan Campbell</em>, who describes himself as a native of Kilmun,
Cowal, published a “Gaelic Song Book” at Cork, 1798.</p>

<p><em>John Macgregor</em>, published a volume of 227 pages in 1801, at
Edinburgh. There is none of decided merit.</p>

<p><em>Angus Kennedy</em>, a native of Ardgour, Argyllshire, published a
volume at Glasgow in 1808. One or two of his songs have become
very popular.</p>

<p><em>William Gordon</em>, a native of Creich, Sutherlandshire, published
a volume of 156 pages in 1802. He was a soldier, and in his
latter days composed religious hymns.</p>

<p><em>Margaret Macgregor’s</em> poems appear in Mackintosh’s Collection
in 1831.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>There were many other composers of one or a few songs or
poems which may be found in various collections of whom we
know little or nothing more than their mere names. To this class
belong Donald Macintyre of North Argyll, George Morison of
the far North, William MacMurchie of Kintyre, Alexander Macinnes
of Glencoe, Maclachlan of Kilbride, and some female
composers who are only known as the wives or daughters of men
described as of certain localities. There does not appear to have
been a parish or clachan in the Highlands and Isles that has not
brought forth its own singer.</p>


<h3>WILLIAM ROSS.</h3>

<p>This sensitive and delightful poet was born at Broadford, Isle of
Skye, in 1762. He received good education at the parish school
of Forres, where he highly distinguished himself. He made a particular
study of his native language, and was also well acquainted
with Latin and Greek. He sang sweetly, and played
on the violin, flute, and other instruments with considerable skill.
He became parish schoolmaster of Gairloch, Ross-shire, where he
was a very successful teacher. He did not fill this situation, however,
very long. He died of consumption in 1790, in the twenty-eighth
year of his age. His early death is said to have been hastened
by a love disappointment. In <cite lang="gd">Cuachag nan Eraobh</cite>, one of his
best-known songs, he indulges in melancholy and painful reflections.
It is addressed to a cuckoo that settled on the branch of
a tree beside him. He remembers his false love and <span class="nowrap">sings:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nought to me but a sting all her bright beauties bring—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I droop with decay, and I languish;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s a pain at my heart like a pitiless dart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I waste all away with anguish.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She has stolen the hue on my young cheeks that grew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And much she has caused my sorrow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unless now she renew with her kindness that hue</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Death will soon bid me “Good morrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Death did soon bid poor Ross “good morrow” and in this song,
like Michael Bruce, he sang his own elegy. How pathetically
the poet cries in the prospect of <span class="nowrap">death!—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">If she were thus low, with what haste should I go</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To ask how the maiden was faring:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now short the delay till a mournful array</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The brink of my grave will be bearing!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>Ross is a poet of a high order, and one of the sweetest minstrels
the Highlands have produced. Many of his songs are
highly popular. The exquisite sweetness and finish of Ross appear
in his praise of the “Highland Maid,” the first two stanzas
of which are rendered as follows by Mr Angus Macphail, whose
early death has been a loss to Gaelic <span class="nowrap">literature:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My pretty Highland maiden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With tresses golden bright,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And soft hands snowy white;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er Scotland’s hills and plains</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With thee I fain would go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wrapped in our native tartan plaids</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That in the breezes flow.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me my Highland dress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Tis grand beyond compare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me my Highland maid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sweet, smiling, young, and fair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then banish sleep and care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From eve to rosy morn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In happy love beneath our plaid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The proudest dress that’s worn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ross is one of the best known and best loved of all the Gaelic
bards. His career, so similar to that of Keats, ends so prematurely
and pathetically that his memory has become engraven on
the hearts of all who hear his story and love to sing his songs.</p>


<h3>EWEN MACLACHLAN.</h3>

<p>Ewen MacLachlan, a poet of real culture, sweetness, and light,
was born in 1775, in Torracaltin, Coiruanan, where his ancestors,
who originally came from Morven, were for several generations.
His great-grandfather was a bard of note. He was educated first
in the parish school of Fort-William, and afterwards in King’s
College, Aberdeen. While carrying on his studies he was tutor
successively in the family of Cameron of Camishy, in that of
Cameron of Clunes, and in that of Macmillan of Glenpean.
He distinguished himself highly at school and at the University,
especially in classics. He intended to enter the Church,
but on the eve of taking license some friends dissuaded him from
taking the step, recommending him to wait, and aim at a professorial
chair. Among these was the gentle author of “The
Minstrel,” Professor Beattie, who thought much of MacLachlan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
and became his fast friend. In 1798 MacLachlan published some
of his own productions in Allan Dall’s volume, which he himself
committed to writing for the Blind Bard. These were the
“Songs of the Seasons,” etc., and several books of Homer’s
Iliad translated into Gaelic heroic verse. In 1818 he published
his “Metrical Effusions,” where Greek, Latin, English, and Gaelic
poems appear. He was engaged by the Highland Society of Scotland
to compile a Gaelic dictionary. For this work he was eminently
qualified, being intimately acquainted with old Gaelic, as
well as with Eastern and classical languages. He died before the
work was finished, in 1822, in the 47th year of his age. When
he died he was head master of the Grammar School of Old Aberdeen,
a post for which his classical attainments peculiarly fitted
him. A love-song by MacLachlan—<cite lang="gd">Gur gile mo Leannan</cite>—is
still among the most popular in the language. He himself has
furnished us with an English equivalent, which will give a fair
idea of the more tender qualities of his genius. These simple
and pretty verses, usually sung to a plaintive air, come to us laden
with the purity and freshness of the mountain <span class="nowrap">breeze:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Not the swan on the lake, or the foam on the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can compare with the charms of the maid I adore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not so white is the new milk that flows o’er the pail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the snow that is show’r’d from the boughs of the vale.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As the cloud’s yellow wreath on the mountain’s high brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The locks of my fair one redundantly flow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her cheeks have the tint that the roses display.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When they glitter with dew on the morning of May.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As the planet of Venus that gleams o’er the grove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her blue rolling eyes are the symbols of love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her pearl-circled bosom diffuses bright rays,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the moon, when the stars are bedimm’d with her blaze.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The mavis and lark, when they welcome the dawn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make a chorus of joy to resound through the lawn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the mavis is tuneless—the lark strives in vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When my beautiful charmer renews her sweet strain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When summer bespangles the landscape with flow’rs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the thrush and the cuckoo sing soft from the bowr’s,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the wood-shaded windings with Bella I’ll rove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And feast unrestrain’d on the smiles of my love.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>MacLachlan counted a number of distinguished men among
his friends—among others, Alexander, Duke of Gordon; the late
Glengarry, Sir John Sinclair, Dr Gregory, and Lord Bannatyne
Macleod. His funeral was attended by the Professors of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
University and Magistrates of the city to show their respect. His
remains were removed to his native Lochaber for burial. On the
way to the burial place at Killievaodain in Ardgour the hearse
was met and accompanied to the last resting-place by Glengarry
and a number of his clansmen dressed in their native garb. Few
of MacLachlan’s talents and culture in modern times have devoted
their energies to the cultivation of Gaelic literature. There
is a reason: the practical spirit of the nineteenth century has,
perhaps desirably, cooled even the enthusiasm of bardic natures.</p>


<h3>JOHN MACLEAN.</h3>

<p>Among the bards of some note who flourished in the first
quarter of this century is John MacLean, usually styled the Laird
of Coll’s Bard. He is one of the last of the order of family <a id="tn-274">bards,
or senachies</a>. But the office in his case does not appear to have
been of much advantage to himself—it was more honourable <a id="tn-274a">and
ornamental</a> than remunerative. MacLean was born in the
Island of Tiree in 1787. As an instance of the tenacity with
which Highlanders cleave to the traditional pedigrees of their
families, it maybe mentioned that he traced himself back through
the MacLeans of Treisinnis, of Ardgour, and of Duart to the great
<em>Hector Roy of the Battles</em>, who was killed at Harlaw in 1411.
But this is a small claim as compared with that advanced by a
Dublin schoolmaster, John O’Hart, who, in a pamphlet dedicated
to her Majesty Queen Victoria, whom he regards somewhat as a
fellow-sovereign, pretends to trace his pedigree to the mighty
monarchs of Eire who once reigned in “Tara’s Hall!” MacLean
published a collection of poetry, most of the pieces being his
own composition, in 1818; another volume of his own poems appeared
at Antigonish in 1836. His works complete have since
been issued in excellent style under the title of “<span lang="gd">Clàrsach na
Coille</span>” (Harp of the Wood), edited with intelligence and care by
the Rev. A. M. Sinclair of Nova Scotia, whose Gaelic scholarship
and enthusiasm are well known on this side of the Atlantic. It
is said that “in the poet’s younger days the people of Tiree led
merry lives; they did not trouble themselves with hard work;
they had, however, plenty to eat and drink. The island was full
of distilleries, and whisky-drinking was carried on to a very great
extent. There were capital dancers in the place, and certainly
these men did not allow their legs to become stiff through want of
exercise upon the floor.” This picture of island-life suggests the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
material which was frequently the source of inspiration to bardic
lucubrations. After learning the trade of shoemaking, MacLean
started for Glasgow, where he married. In 1810 he was drafted
into the militia, but was discharged next year. In 1819 he emigrated
to Nova Scotia, where he lived till the year 1848, much respected
and appreciated by all his countrymen who knew him. It
appears that MacLean has composed religious poetry, though little
known—some of his hymns being printed in Glasgow in 1835.
Here is an account of this side of his nature: “It was not till he
had been several years in Barney’s River that he turned his attention
to this species of composition. His hard lot in this world no
doubt tended to direct his attention to a better world. He had
always led a good moral life—a more truthful or a more honest
could not be found. He had always observed the worship of
God regularly in his family.” MacLean is a bard of considerable
powers, but cannot be compared with the bards whose names
are known wherever the Gaelic language is spoken. One song of
his has been highly popular, mainly because of the sweet air that
is attached to it. The following verses will show the manner of
the song, <span lang="gd"><i>Och a rùin gur tu air</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>m’aire</i>:—</span></span></p>

<p>This song is so painfully simple and commonplace, notwithstanding
its popularity, that it can scarcely bear translation at all, unless
the translator is permitted to introduce some of the stock
sentiment and phraseology of the muse. One of MacLean’s best
pieces is on the <cite>Laird of Coll’s Boat</cite>. Another of more than
average merit was written shortly after his arrival in Nova Scotia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>

<p>MacLean is one of the last of the old order of bards. His
poetry shows little or no trace of English reading; and the theme
of the majority of his poems is the praise of the Laird of Coll or
some kindred chieftain. Very appropriately might the happy
couplet of Sir Walter Scott describing the old and infirm minstrels
of other days be applied to <span class="nowrap">MacLean—</span></p>

<p>Considerable activity was shown in the beginning of this century
in collecting the floating mass of poetry then extant in the
Highlands. Celtic patriots who dreaded the immediate decease
of the ancient language of Albin set themselves in praiseworthy
fashion to the task of rescuing this popular literature from the
devouring jaws of time and change. A brief survey of the various
publications which were the practical outcome of this happy determination
will exhibit no unworthy results. These results, in
many cases achieved at great self-sacrifice, are more deserving of
notice when it is remembered how expensive it was then to publish
bulky volumes, especially in the Gaelic language, and how
limited was the constituency to whose support the persistent
patriots appealed. Their devotion to their venerable mother-tongue,
supposed to be on her death-bed, deserves our gratitude;
and if their ghosts occasionally revisit in the glimpses of the
moon, the scenes of their self-denying labours, they must be gratified
to hear still the echoes of their much-loved tongue resounding
as of yore through the glens and by the seashore as well as in
crowded halls in our large centres of population. Peace be <a id="tn-277">to
their names</a>! and long may the torch of Gaelic enthusiasm, which
they kept lighted, and handed down to us, be preserved a burning
power in the bosoms of our Highland countrymen.</p>

<p>It is not proposed to do here much more than the mere enumeration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
of some of these collections of poetry. This itself will
be sufficient, along with the array of Gaelic bards that have already
passed in review before us, to show further how unfounded is the
general dictum that there is no Gaelic literature—no books in the
language of the Highlander.</p>

<p>Some popular songs of this period are—“<span lang="gd">Mairi Dhonn</span>” and
“<span lang="gd">Mairi Ghreannar</span>,” by Kenneth Mackenzie of Lochbroom;
“<span lang="gd">’Scanail m’Aigne</span>,” and “<span lang="gd">Soraidh Slàn do’n Ailleagan</span>,” <a id="tn-278">by the
brothers</a> William and Alexander Mackenzie, of Lochcarron;
“<span lang="gd">An Làr Dhonn</span>,” by Murdoch Mackenzie, of Achilty, Ross-shire;
“<span lang="gd">Thug mi’n Oidhche raoir san Airidh</span>,” by John Macgillivray;
“<span lang="gd">Gaor nam Ban Muileach</span>,” by Margaret Maclean of Mull;
“<span lang="gd">O’n tha mi fo Mhuladh air m’Aineol</span>,” by the Rev. Charles
Stewart, D.D., of Strachur; “<span lang="gd">Nighean Donn na Buaile</span>,” by the
Rev. Duncan Macfarlane, latterly of Perth; “<span lang="gd">Gu ma slàn a chì
Mi</span>,” by Hector Mackenzie, an Ullapool sailor; “<span lang="gd">A Nighean
Bhui Bhan</span>,” by Donald Macinnes; “<span lang="gd">Mo run geal Og</span>,” by Christina
Ferguson, of Contin; “<span lang="gd">Thainig an Gille Dubh</span>,” by Lady
Malcolm Raasay; “<span lang="gd">A Mhairi Bhòidheach</span>,” by a North <a id="tn-278a">Uist
schoolmaster</a>; “<span lang="gd">Moladh Caber-Féidh</span>,” by Norman Macleod of
Assynt, whose two sons, Professor Macleod of Glasgow and the
Rev. Augus Macleod of Rogart, were well known last century.</p>

<p>Anonymous pieces are many: “<span lang="gd">An Gille Dubh ciar Dubh</span>,”
“<span lang="gd">Mo Nighean Chruinn Donn</span>;” “<span lang="gd">Fear a’ Bhàta</span>;” “<span lang="gd">Cuir a
Chinn Dìleas</span>;” “<span lang="gd">An Nochd gur faoin mo Chadal domh</span>;”
“<span lang="gd">Och mar tha Mi</span>;” “<span lang="gd">Ho-ro Eileinich, Ho-gu</span>” (the three last
being evidently composed by Islaymen); “<span lang="gd">Tha Tigh’n Fodham”
(MacDhughail, ’ic Lachuin?)</span>, a verse of which Boswell boasted of
being able to sing when he was with Johnson on his tour in the
Hebrides. The popular collections of songs will supply many
more.</p>

<p>Since 1812 the following collections of miscellaneous pieces of
poetry have appeared:—P. Macfarlane’s (1813); in this volume
was first published a part of MacLachlan’s translation of Homer
(the 3rd Book). P. Turner’s (1813), mostly culled from the works
of the well-known heroic bards. H. and J. MacCallum’s (1816),
principally Ossianic or heroic ballads. J. MacLean’s (1818),
containing much original matter. Inverness collection (1821,
Fraser); James Munro’s <cite lang="gd">Ailleagan</cite> (1830), which has maintained
its popularity all along. Other small things appeared early in the
century—<cite lang="gd">Eoin Bheag nan Creagaibh Aosda</cite> (1819); <cite lang="gd">Ceilleirean
Binn nan Creagan Aosda</cite> (1819), and a choice collection of Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
Songs with Gaelic translations (Inverness, 1829). “The Harp of
Caledonia,” “<span lang="gd">An t-Aosdana</span>,” “The Mountain Songster,” “<span lang="gd">An
Duanaire</span>,” have been published more recently, and are still
in circulation. The most valuable of all the collections is “The
Beauties of Gaelic Poetry”—a magnificent volume, on which
much labour was spent, by John Mackenzie. The productions of
many of the Gaelic bards are given in this work, along with biographical
notices, and much critical and explanatory matter.
Mackenzie, who was a native of Wester Ross, was a man of
great talent and industry; but his æsthetic and moral tastes not
being of a high order, he allowed many pieces of an <a id="tn-279">immoral tendency</a>
to appear, which somewhat marred the work. It is the
<i lang="la">magnum opus</i> of Gaelic literature. The “<span lang="gd">Oranaiche</span>,” by Archibald
Sinclair (1879) is another large and excellent work, which
does great credit to the compiler and publisher. With the exception
of the “Beauties,” which is of a different sort, there is no
collection in Gaelic like Sinclair’s, whether we regard the variety,
the extent, and the quality of the contents.</p>

<p>While the “Beauties” contain the best productions of the principal
bards during the last three hundred years, the “<span lang="gd">Oranaiche</span>,”
gives us the better known songs of the present century, many of
the lyrics being the compositions of living writers, from whom
Mr Sinclair, often at very considerable trouble to himself,
obtained the manuscripts, and took down the words at the
author’s or others’ dictation. There are two hundred and ninety
songs in this handsome volume, many of them very long—a general
characteristic of Gaelic songs—and not a few, it must be
admitted, more of the nature of poems than of lyrics. The songs
in this collection are of all sorts—humorous, patriotic, satiric, and
sentimental. The latter class predominates; indeed, it constitutes
three-fifths of the whole. In considering the range of poetic
culture discernible in this volume, it is remarkable to note the
almost total absence of martial songs. The bards of this century
would appear to have been baptised in the perennial stream of the
tender passion of which they sing with such evidently luscious
delight. This is the one great theme which they take up with
the devotion of their whole being. Another subject which here
and there gives a tinge of sadness to the book is the depopulation
of the Highlands, which is so fitted, like the troubles of a jilted
and suffering lover, to elicit, in all its intensity, the melancholic
element in the Celtic nature. <cite lang="gd">Mac-na-bracha</cite> (Son of Malt) also
comes <a id="tn-279a">in for frequent</a> and hearty praise, drinking <cite lang="gd">Deoch-slainte</cite><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
being capable at all times of invoking in many Highland bosoms
the purest and most generous feelings and sympathies. It ought
to be observed, however, as Sheriff Nicolson suggests in his excellent
volume of Gaelic proverbs, that although <i lang="gd">usqueba</i> is so much
identified with the failings of the modern Highlander, this exhilarating
beverage was almost unknown to the Gael until last century,
the drink known till then being mostly “<span lang="gd">fion dearg na Frainc,</span>”
<em>the red wine of France</em>. It has been remarked above, that this
volume does not present us with many martial lyrics. This fact
reminds us of the great change that has come over the Highlands.
The obvious explanation is that the warlike ardour which was
wont to flow forth in battle incitements has been toned down by
the altered circumstances of the people since the day of Culloden,
and runs now into the natural stream of the tender passion. On
the other hand, if we go back to the days of Finian chivalry we
find a martial element in all the productions of the bards; and
this continued largely to prevail as long as the Gael habitually
carried about with him his claymore, ready to fight for his person
or follow his chief to the field.</p>

<p>One of the best, and the only genuine martial song in the
“<span lang="gd">Oranaiche</span>,” is the first in the volume, <cite lang="gd">Buaidh leis na Seoid</cite>,
by Alexander Macgregor, schoolmaster at Dull. It contains sixteen
stanzas of four lines of twelve syllables in length, and having
a chorus takes a long time to sing it; but the martial enthusiasm
it breathes, along with many suggestive historical references, are
such that audiences sit frequently spellbound till the whole piece
is rehearsed. Of the humorous pieces in the volume mention may
be made of <cite>The Dun Horse</cite>, <cite>The Minister and the Bailie</cite>, and
<cite>The Advent of an Escaped Irish Balloon on the shore of one of the
Hebrides</cite>. The author of the last-mentioned represents the whole
island as in commotion when the monster approached the shore—old
men and old women taking for granted that this could be
no less a personage than the devil himself, who came at last to
claim his own.</p>

<p>There are upwards of fifty names of composers in the “<span lang="gd">Oranaiche</span>,”
many of whom are still living, and who are not known
on the pages of another book. With this fact before us surely
it cannot be affirmed that the race of bards is gone. I was
once present at a meeting of a Highland Association in Glasgow,
where I was informed there were no less than six bards, authors of
published, well-known songs. It is difficult to conceive how so
many of the irritable genius could work in harmony or dwell together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
in unity and in poetic brotherhood. Among the fifty above-mentioned
occur the following less known Celtic names:—Lady
D’Olyly D. Orr, MacMurchie, MacPhail, Macroy, MacLugas,
MacAffer, Wilkinson, etc. etc. Let us now glance at some of
the best-known songs.</p>

<p><cite lang="gd">Gu ma Slan a chi Mi</cite>, the composition of an Ullapool sailor,
the air of which is very pretty, is a highly popular song. I have
tried to render some verses of it <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<p>Some of the most popular songs are anonymous. <cite lang="gd">Ho-ro Eileinich</cite>
belongs to this class, and is a great favourite at large Highland
gatherings on account of the swinging character of the air and
metre. Here are a few verses:—</p>

<p>One of the finest songs in the language is <cite lang="gd">Muile nam Mor

<p>A glance into the <i lang="gd">Oranaiche</i> and other collections of Gaelic
songs will reveal to the casual student of Gaelic literature what
vast treasures of lyrics the language contains. These songs admirably
exhibit the emotional lyrical spirit of the Gael, and leads
us to much of the source of the genius of song which has rendered
Scotland so deservedly renowned.</p>

<p>The Rev. Angus Macintyre, late of Kinlochspelvie, composed
several poems of great merit. His love-song, “<span lang="gd">O’s runach leam
an ribhinn donn</span>,” is very pretty. <a id="tn-283">A translation by</a> Mr H. Whyte

<p>One of the popular songs and airs among Highlanders is that
of “Finary.” The verses that have become so well-known in
connection with this song are not those to which the air was attached
originally. The original song was “<span lang="gd">Irinn àrinn u horo</span>,”
by Allan Macdougall, a lyric of fair merit, but which has never
attained to anything like the popularity of “Finary.” The author
of “Finary” appropriated an air already popular, like the author of
“<span lang="gd">Màiri Laghach.</span>” The reputed author of “Finary” is the elder
Dr Norman Macleod, and certainly the theme of the song is
founded on an event in his personal history. It is a farewell to
Finary, where the manse of his father was situated, in Morven, on
the occasion of Norman leaving home to attend the first session
at Glasgow University. The sentiment is very pathetic and
natural, and very readily lays hold of the tenderest chords of the
heart of the home-loving Highlander. There is something about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
it, the antiquarian reference to the past, and its touches descriptive
of natural scenery, which remind us of the genius of Macleod.
Yet it has been doubted whether he was the author of the original
English version—the English one being regarded as the original.
Mr Neil Campbell, of County Down, now of Glasgow, a man
who knows a good deal of generally unknown facts relating to the
Gaelic literature of this century, once told the writer that the Rev.
Mr Kelly, of Campbeltown, once Dr Macleod’s friend and colleague
in that town, was the author of the English version, which,
apart from the home-loving sentiment and air, is rather poor
poetry. The following is the first verse, which shows reason but
the veriest imperfection of <span class="nowrap">rhyme:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The wind is fair, the day is <em>fine</em>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swiftly, swiftly runs the <em>time</em>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boat is floating on the <em>tide</em>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That wafts me off from Finary.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But apart from the artistic execution of the verses, the sweet,
high-souled, and patriotic sentiments conveyed in them would
always recommend them to the warm-hearted and emotional Gael.
The history of “<span lang="gd">Fionnairidh</span>” has always seemed to me something
like that of “God Save the Queen,” or “The Address to the
Cuckoo.” The names of Bruce and Lowe are connected with the
last just as those of Macleod and Kelly are with the first. One of
the few who could authoritatively decide the precise authorship of
“Fionnairidh”—was that true and highly-gifted Highlander the
late Dr John Macleod of Morven; and also his learned relative Dr
Clerk of Kilmailie, who could write with accuracy of the different
versions, English and Gaelic, of <cite lang="gd">Eirich agus tiugainn, O</cite>.</p>

<p>The following Gaelic version—eight stanzas, there are four
more—are given as they came through the hands of the late
Archibald Sinclair, who had probably something to do with it.
It was first printed on a leaflet, was then copied into the “Gael”
in 1872, and has been several times published in whole or in part
<span class="nowrap">since:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But matters are still further complicated in connection with this
favourite song. A gentleman from North Argyll assured the
writer that another Gaelic version was in general circulation long
ago in Mull and Morven. This might have been the original
one by Dr Macleod himself, from which Kelly translated; and
the fact that the original chorus, “<i lang="gd">Eirich agus tiugainn O</i>,” has
been known only in Gaelic favours this supposition. Surely old
folks in Morven must still be able to repeat this supposed original
version if it ever had existence. If so, it is to be hoped that
some one will take the trouble of giving it to the world. But
whoever the author was, the song has obtained unquestionable
hold of the Highland heart, no doubt largely because it refers to
an early event in the history of the “Highlander’s friend,” the
good, genial, and large hearted Norman Macleod.</p>

<p>Poetry like that of A Mackay, of Moyhall (1821), of Archibald
Grant, of Glenmoriston (1863), of John Macinnes (1875),
Callum Macphail (1879), and of John Macfadyen (1890), shows
excellent ease in verse-making, and no small amount of humour
at times; but it does not demand serious examination. That
so many volumes should be published indicates much activity
and energy on the part of an obscure Gaelic muse.</p>

<p>Another bard of the name of Grant may be mentioned as belonging
to this class. Many of the popular lyrics have been composed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
by authors who have not given us more than one or two
songs. <cite lang="gd">Mo Nighean Dubh</cite> was written by the Rev. Mr Morrison
of Petty; <cite lang="gd">Mairi Laghach</cite>, by John Macdonald of Lochbroom;
<cite lang="gd">Bonneid is it</cite>, by A. Macalister of Islay; <cite lang="gd">Eilein an Fhraoich</cite>, by
M. MacLeod of Lewis. The mass of lyrics of this class is something
enormous. When translated into English they are felt to be
simple—sometimes painfully simple—metrical inartistic utterances
of love-enkindled hearts. Attached to tender and often very
pretty airs they have lived on the lips of thousands, and have
cheered weary workers in the field and at the fireside. Of the
nameless class of plaintive lilts is the following:—<cite lang="gd">Mo Run Geal
Dileas</cite>, well known throughout the Highlands. There are many
versions of it, and the number of verses is scarcely ever the same.
The <a id="tn-287">chorus is rather</a> unintelligible, and may have belonged to an
earlier set of verses. The verses translated give a very fair conception
of the merits and the spirit of the original. Like the
Laureate’s <cite lang="gd">Mariana</cite>, many of these Highland singers show much
of the “a-weary, a-weary” condition of soul, and people of pretended
lofty moral culture condemn the poor lyrists for manifesting
such excess of feeling.</p>

<p><cite lang="gd">Mairi Laghach</cite> has become a great favourite, and has been
translated more than once. The author was John Macdonald,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
latterly of Crobeg, in Lewis. He adopted the chorus of an inferior
song which a <i lang="gd">Muracha nam Bo</i> composed for his own daughter,
who did not seem to elicit much admiration from the ungallant
bachelors in the neighbourhood. Macdonald took up the
air and composed the set of verses that are now so popular. It
is worthy of remark that in his case also the subject of his song
was a baby, and not a grown-up girl or woman. Steering his
barque across the Minch his thoughts reverted to the friendly
home he left behind him in Stornoway, and anxious to examine
his poetic gifts he composed his song to <cite>Wee Mary</cite>, as it might
be rendered, who then could not walk. Eventually she became
his wife. Once on a visit to Ireland, the author was surprised to
hear, while he himself was still a young man, his own song sung in
an adjoining room, which shows how readily a song that catches
the popular ear and taste will travel.</p>

<p>It is of course impossible to preserve the music of the original
in any translation; the renderings given above are intended
merely to indicate something of the spirit of the lyric treasures enshrined
in Gaelic. Any one turning to our collections of poetry,
especially to Sinclair’s “<span lang="gd">Oranaiche</span>,” will at once see that the
Highlands are as rich as the Lowlands in song literature, and
that the poetry produced, is of an equally high order. There are
hundreds of pieces nameless and claimless on the lips of thousands
which will continue to be sung as long as there will be a tongue
to speak the Gaelic language. Such has been the poetic literature
which for ages the Gael has chiefly loved and cherished, and
the better recognition of which would enable the Highlander and
Lowlander alike to show to the world a body of song such as no
country of the size of Scotland has ever yet produced. Many
suppose that the ancient language of Caledonia is dead or dying;—it
was never read nor written so extensively as now. And it
ought to be further remembered that the lyric genius of the Highland
Celt is not confined to what we have in Gaelic. Many men
of Gaelic extraction have exhibited their gift of song and music in
other spheres. Not to speak of the poets Ferguson and Burns, in
whose veins Celtic blood largely flowed, Thomas Campbell, was
one of these. Hector Macneill, the hope of Scotland <a id="tn-289">after the
death</a> of Burns, was another. The connection of Lord Macaulay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
with the lyric genius of the Gael has been already pointed
out. The songs of Dr Charles Mackay are known to all the
readers of English poetry; and those of Peter Macneill of Tranent
are on the full tide of popular esteem. The names of
George Macdonald and Robert Buchanan are familiar to all the
students of contemporary literature. In the kindred spheres of
music and the drama we come across the names of Mr Hamish
MacCunn, Dr A. C. Mackenzie, President of the Royal Academy
of Music, and the prima donna Miss Macintyre. Scores of others
might be mentioned whose genius is traceable to their Gaelic
extraction, there being scarcely a Highland clan name that has
not its representative among the crowned sons of song. In the
ecclesiastical world the stars of Celtic or Gaelic names are a
legion. The position of Archbishop in the great see of York
has been attained successively by two men of Gaelic extraction—the
eloquent Magee being a descendant of the Mackays of
Islay, and his successor MacLagan being a member of a distinguished
Highland family which has given us the Gaelic bard MacLagan,
a profound Professor of Theology, late of Aberdeen—and
now the Archbishop himself.</p>

<p>The survey which we have just taken of our popular poetry
clearly indicates that the Gaelic is still the language in which
many compose and write. Many would heartily sing thus with
Professor <span class="nowrap">Blackie:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">At the same time we have no wish to preserve Gaelic, as Professor
Blackie has said, in any artificial or galvanised existence. We
merely ask fair-play for it on the scene of linguistic competition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">And this fair-play it is now more than ever likely to receive, the
Highlanders having their own representatives now in Parliament
and in the county and parochial councils. As long as bards continue
to arise—and there is no sign that the supply will be readily
exhausted—and the people love to rehearse their strains, so long
will the Gaelic remain a living factor in the land. In these pages
it is attempted to show the extent and nature of this sort of literature
of the people; but as Highlanders we do not wish, in attempting
to bring the literature of our language before the world, to
challenge comparison with other bodies of literature. Our main
purpose is served if we succeed in showing to our fellow-countrymen,
Highland and Lowland, that there are national literary treasures
which have been hitherto comparatively overlooked, and
which ought in an important degree to add to the already high
fame of bonnie Scotland as a land whose glens and bens, whose
rivers and lakes are everywhere vocal with songs of love and
patriotism.</p>

<p>Before the plough of cruel eviction from their homes cut deep
furrows into the Highland heart, the bards, such as Duncan Bàn,
loved to sing of the pleasures of the chase; but the second quarter
of the nineteenth century witnessed a change in this respect.
A new, if not a revolutionary spirit—at least one of discontent—got
abroad throughout the land. This “divine discontent”
seized upon the Highland bards, and the burning strains of Maclachlan
of Morven and William Livingston, no longer ran in the
older moulds of Macintyre and others. The extension of the
franchise, the study of history and the science of language, the
growing sympathy with oppressed nationalities, the revival of
Christian forces, and the increasing value attached to human life,—these
and many other “cries of the human,” helped forward a
movement which may be fitly described as a <em><a id="tn-292">Celtic Renaissance</a></em>.
This Highland movement was reinforced by kindred and sympathetic
influences from Ireland, Wales, and circles of social and
linguistic learning on the Continent, until it eventually bore statutory
fruit in the Highland Land Act of 1886, which constitutes
an Imperial Charter of hereditary right to their native land for the
Gaelic-speaking communities of Scotland. This was an achievement
which even bards with millennial visions and hopes could
scarcely look forward to a generation ago.</p>

<p>The wails of the bards over Highland depopulation, however,
nursed the people’s discontent as well as their resolution to assert
themselves. A good proportion of the authors whose compositions
come under notice in this chapter come under the spell of
the Celtic Renaissance. Indeed this spirit of national resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
is the vital force pervading their productions which would be
poor and barren without it.</p>


<h3>EVAN MACCOLL.</h3>

<p>At the head of the Bards of the Victorian era stands Evan
MacColl, who was born in 1808 at Kenmore, Lochfyneside,
Argyleshire, where his father was a small farmer. Young MacColl
eagerly seized on all the sources of culture within his reach,
and at an early age became familiar with some of the chief works
of English literature. He was born and educated in the midst of
strongly Celtic influences and associations which continued to
mould his mind and heart throughout his whole career.</p>

<p>In 1836 he published “<cite>The Mountain Minstrel; or, <span lang="gd">Clarsach
nam Beann</span></cite>,” a series of English and Gaelic poems and songs.
He is one of the best known of our living Gaelic bards. Fletcher
of Dunans and Campbell of Islay, to whom the English and
Gaelic parts of his volume are respectively dedicated, befriended
the young bard, who had proved himself highly deserving of the
patronage they extended to him. The genius of MacColl is entirely
lyrical, very few poems of any length having come from his
pen. His English songs are generally playful and pleasant, but
do not show much depth of passion. His Gaelic poems have the
same ring as his English pieces, but are more natural, and <a id="tn-293">show
the bard</a> at his ease in the use of language. MacColl is a sweet
and intelligent singer, but in real power of thought and expression
he is not Livingston’s equal. The following verses show MacColl
in his more vigorous <span class="nowrap">style:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">“Ho! landed upon Moidart’s coast is Scotland’s rightful King!”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And soon, glad-buckling on their arms, stout chiefs and clansmen true</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have sworn in his good cause to try what good broadswords can do.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No cravens they to count the cost of failure; man alive!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll never see their like again—the Clans of ’Forty-five.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Grey chiefs, who for his fathers fought, the fire of youth revive,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Would place his father’s crown or die. Too well they kept their vow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let men who prate of loyalty in this <em>our</em> day derive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Instruction in that virtue from the Clans of ’Forty-five.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The Chisholm, Cluny, Brahan’s lord, the Mackintosh so keen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Appin Stuarts and MacColls, the lion-hearts Maclean,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With many a Chief and Clan besides, who quickly did contrive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make their names immortal in the famous ’Forty-five!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet, who entered the Liverpool Custom-House in 1839
through W. F. Campbell of Islay, M.P. then for Argyleshire,
removed to Canada in 1850, where in a similar position at Kingston
he remained until he was superannuated in 1880. The venerable
poet, now in the eighty third year of his age, resides in
Canada, where a son of his is an able Congregational minister,
and a daughter known as a poetess of much merit.</p>

<p>None of the Gaelic bards had a wider acquaintance, nor a
larger outlook of life than MacColl. But in the midst of all new
associations and attractions, he remained at heart frankly and
even sternly Highland. The following verse of an address (1878),
to a well-known Highland patriot, Mr John Murdoch, illustrates
this phase of his <span class="nowrap">character:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I think I see thy manly form,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firm and unyielding as Cairngorm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The poor man’s cause maintaining warm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Just like a true-souled Highlander;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I see the scorn within thine eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>As some evicting Chief goes by—</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One whose forbears would sooner die</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Than dispossess a Highlander.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before Celtic things were held in such esteem as they are now,
or rather, perhaps, before their value was appreciated as recently,
men of Celtic extraction like Macaulay and Charles Mackay
wrote of the Highlanders and Highlands, not only without discrimination
and sympathy, but without knowledge, and even in a
spirit of savage contempt. The latter lived to express regret for
his earlier conduct; the former had not the same opportunity of
modifying his earlier impressions, and his Highland fellow-countrymen
were not slow to declare their minds on the subject. Among
those who sought to pay back the illustrious historian in his own
coin was Evan MacColl. On the occasion of Macaulay’s death
some one had written “Macaulay now is registered among England’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
mighty dead!” On this MacColl wrote verses the first
and last of which are as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hech, sirs! “Macaulay’s registered</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Mong England’s mighty dead!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us hope that he lies buried near</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her first mean-mighty Ned.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scotland can never well forget</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The zeal of those two men,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The one to stab her with the sword—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The other with the pen.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div><hr class="tb"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But let that pass,—he’s there—John Bull</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is not so much to blame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He lived to magnify John’s rule,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">John magnifies <em>his</em> name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wonder, after all, is how</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">John could be fooled so far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a mere meteoric light</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To worship as a star.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The warm and generous heart of the bard is revealed in much of
his poetry. His little poem, <cite>Let us do the best we can</cite>, shows his
sympathy with the struggling <span class="nowrap">poor:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mark yon worldling lost in self,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Dead to every social glow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wouldst thou, to own all his pelf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All life’s purer joys forego?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Truest wealth is doing good—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Doctrine strange to him, poor man!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If we can’t do all we would,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Let us do the best we can.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the best criticisms on MacColl’s poetry comes from the
pen of Hugh Miller: “There is more of fancy than of imagination
in the poetry of MacColl, and more of thought and imagery
than of feeling. In point, glitter, polish, he is the Moore of
Highland song. Comparison and ideality are the leading features
of his mind. Some of the pieces in this volume are sparkling
tissues of comparison from beginning to end.”</p>


<h3>JAMES MUNRO.</h3>

<p>A little volume, <cite lang="gd">Am Filldh</cite>, mostly written by James Munro
(1840), author of the “Gaelic Grammar,” contains a great deal of
first-class poetry. In the composition of small pieces of the sentimental
kind, Munro is scarcely inferior to Livingston in freshness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
and condensation, and is MacColl’s equal. We have in the
“<span lang="gd">Filidh</span>” several pieces by other hands, as well as excellent
translations from the English. Munro was a man of thorough
culture, and profoundly acquainted with the extent and idioms of
the Gaelic language. Of all this there is undoubted evidence in
his poetry. Here is a rendering of one of Munro’s songs, which
is attached to a very fine <span class="nowrap">air:—</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>JOHN MACLACHLAN.</h3>

<p>The late Dr Maclachlan of Rahoy, in Morven, stands high as a
poet. A little volume of his poems was published in 1868.
Like all the singers whose works have become popular in the
Highlands, all that he wrote was intended to be sung. He looks
at nature as a man of culture and tender sympathies, and with an
independent eye; and what he sings comes with all the freshness
of the evening breeze as it sweeps o’er the Highland loch. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
theme he especially dwells on—the depopulation of the Highlands.
His heart is saddened as he sees the Lowland shepherd,
who has no sympathy with the place, the people, or their language,
treading with his dogs the glens and hillsides where many expatriated
Gaels had once their happy homes. He has also written
several love lyrics which are admirable in conception and expression.
A song on “Drink,” <cite lang="gd">Cha’n òl mi deur tuille</cite>, is the best of
that sort in the language. Dr Maclachlan lived all his days in
Morven, beside his accomplished neighbour, the Rev. Dr John
MacLeod, himself a man of no mean poetic powers. Although a
skilful practitioner, and possessing considerable talents, he never
sought for a more ambitious sphere. He loved the people around—he
was widely known—and they loved him in return. He
never married, and he lived till he was an old man, not perhaps
less liked by his neighbours for his weakness for a dram, which he
and they thought a necessary beverage in chill and misty Morven.
Here is a translation, well executed by Mr H. Whyte, of one of
Maclachlan’s <span class="nowrap">poems:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O lovely glen! as through a haze</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of tears that dim mine eye,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">To rest beneath the mould.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A new edition of his poems, with a sketch of his life from the pen
of Dr Cameron Gillies, was published some twelve years ago
under the auspices of the Glasgow Morven Association, whose
members had also in hand the erection of a monument to the
bard’s memory.</p>


<h3>ANGUS MACDONALD.</h3>

<p>The compositions of Angus Macdonald, the Glen-Urquhart
Bard, show poetic genius of a high order in the few poems of
his which have yet seen the light. He has left some poems in
manuscript which it is hoped, will some day be published. The
poems in the <cite>Gael</cite> and in the <cite>Inverness Transactions</cite> remind us
of the productions of very kindred spirits, Livingston and R.
Macdougall. He and Livingston seem to have diligently cultivated
the style and manner of Ossian, particularly of the Gaelic
of 1807. He was a master of rich idiomatic Gaelic, and having
also the “accomplishment of verse,” he could make himself terrible
or tender, just as his muse was stirred. He had a particularly
true eye for the beauties of nature; and was always accurate
and graphic in his descriptions. He possessed a keen and cultivated
ear—was a teacher of music for some time; so his verse is
full of melody and harmonious cadences. He excelled in poetry
of the Ossianic type; but, like all masters of the art, he shows
also much tenderness in his love lyrics. He was appointed the
first bard of the Inverness Gaelic Society, an office filled by Mrs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
Mackellar afterwards. He received in 1869 a medal for a prize
poem from “The Club of True Highlanders,” London. His
daughter, Mrs A. Mackenzie of Inverness, has inherited some of
her father’s genius, and is herself the author of compositions of
considerable excellence.</p>


<h3>MARY MACKELLAR.</h3>

<p>A volume of goodly size, <cite>Poems and Songs: Gaelic and English</cite>,
by this poetess, was published in 1881. Mary Mackellar has for
many years been well-known as a woman of bright poetic powers;
and her talents in this respect were some time ago recognised by
the Gaelic Society of Inverness, when she was appointed Bard.
Her poems are characterised by much vigour and freshness, and
evince a subtlety of conception which is quite beyond the ability
of the ordinary Gaelic versifiers. It is premature yet to judge
what position she may take among the Gaelic bards. Her songs,
superior as some of them are, have not yet been accorded much
popularity. There is a sort of straining—an occasional abstruse
Browning element in her Gaelic pieces—which is probably the
cause of this and which has evidently resulted from too close a
following of the abstract conceptions of modern English poets, the
natural utterance of which Gaelic is somewhat unfitted for.
She possesses keen and nervous sensibilities, and looks at nature
with a warm, sympathetic, and observant eye. Like the brook
from the gully she bursts forth with rich thought and melody; but
her poems frequently want breadth of basis. She has generally
the true inspiration, but she does not manage sufficiently to lose
her self-consciousness—to fall into that state of <em>abandon</em> which is
needed for the production of the highest forms of poetry. At the
same time she has proved herself one of the best Gaelic poetesses
the Highlands has produced. Her English pieces are vigorous
and readable. They are not inferior to her Gaelic poems, although
occasionally exhibiting want of Wordsworth’s “accomplishment
of verse” so keenly felt by Hugh Miller in his own case.
All Highlanders welcomed Mary Mackellar’s excellent contribution
to their native literature. She died in 1890 in Edinburgh,
and members of the Cameron Clan—her maiden name being
Cameron—accompanied her remains to their final resting-place
in her native Lochaber.</p>


<h3>DUGALD MACPHAIL.</h3>

<p>This cultivated poet, a native of Mull, author of <cite lang="gd">An t-Eilein
Muileach</cite>, one of the popular songs in the language, was a man of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
strong and well-cultivated intellect, who did not at all give us
what might be expected from one of his rich poetic endowments.
But what he has done is first-class. The most of it will be found
in the “<span lang="gd">Oranaiche.</span>” Macphail was also known as a most effective
Gaelic speaker, as well as a clever writer of Gaelic stories.
He has done good work in translating religious productions, his
translation of MacLaurin’s magnificent sermon on “Glorying in
the Cross of Christ” being one of the best little books in the
Gaelic language.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There are several minor bards whose names have for a long
time been known in different parts of the Highlands—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Macdougall</span>, author of “A Gaelic Guide” to Canada,
where he resided for some time, published an interesting volume
of poems in 1840. Along with original pieces of great merit he
gives a translation of <cite>Tam o’ Shanter</cite>, and of some poems of
Byron, whom he somewhat imitated. He was the first, along
with James Munro, of the new school of poetry to which Livingston,
Angus Macdonald, and others of the present day belong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archibald Campbell</span>, of Kinloch-Earn, brought out a neat
volume of songs and poems in 1831. One or two of them have
become very popular. His style is unaffected, and the sentiment
natural. The whole volume is fully of average merit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Cameron</span>, of Ballachulish, author of “Dan Spioradail”
(1862), has written several poems and songs of considerable merit.
The best-known is <cite lang="gd">Duil ri Bailc-ehaolais fhaicinn</cite>. Like Mary
Mackellar, Cameron did not continue a worshipper at the shrine
of the sacred Muse, to which he seems to have been devoted in his
early days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Campbell</span>, of Leadaig, is well-known as the author of
several excellent poems, one of which has been translated by Professor
Blackie. There is much taste as well as evidence of fair
culture in all that Campbell has written. His poetry is distinguished
by the pastoral sweetness and light of a simple Highland
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Mackorkindale</span>, a native of Islay, afterwards in Canada,
possesses true poetic insight, and had he continued to cultivate
Gaelic poetry he could produce excellent work. Parts of a poetic
dialogue on “<span lang="gd">Dun Bhrusgraidh</span>” by him were reprinted in the
first volume of <cite>The Gael</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Campbell</span>, late of Kinabus, in the same island, composed
a great deal of poetry of more than average merit, but his
compositions were never collected and published. <cite lang="gd">Fuirich a
Ribhinn phriseal</cite> is to be found in the “<span lang="gd">Oranaiche.</span>” The maiden
addressed is Jean Wodrow, daughter of the Kildalton minister,
who published in 1771 a mellifluous rhyming version of <i>Fingal</i>,
founded on Macpherson’s English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rev. Donald Macrae</span>, a native of Plockton, late of Ness,
Lewis, was a true poet, although he did not produce much. A
sweet, pathetic poem, by him, <cite>The Emigrant’s Lament</cite>, written on
the occasion of many of his congregation in Lewis leaving for
Canada, has been much admired, and has been translated into
English by a daughter of late Rev. Dr Gibson of <span class="nowrap">Glasgow:—</span></p>

<h3>WILLIAM LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p>The Bard of Lochfyne is probably the best-known hitherto of
the Gaelic <em>singers</em> of this century; but his place is disputed by
the sweet lyrist of Rahoy. Though not so popular as these two,
as a mere singer, because he has produced so few songs suitable
for singing, William Livingston must be regarded as the most
powerful poetic personality among the Celtic bards of this century.
Like Browning among the English poets, Livingston is less known
than minor claimants for bardic recognition, because the general
reader of Gaelic poetry is not always capable of appreciating anything
higher in the poetic scale than smooth-flowing verse and
mellifluous rhymes that make no demand on the severer exercise
of thought. But his position as a bard among his contemporaries
has been more than once recognised by a few of the most distinguished
Celtic scholars and critics of his time. In competition
for prizes offered by the Glasgow Celtic Society, on three occasions
Livingston obtained the first prize, some of the adjudicators
being the late Rev. Dr Smith of Inverary; the late Rev.
Duncan MacNab of Renfield Free Church, Glasgow; and the late
Rev. Duncan MacLean of Glenorchy;—the last being himself a
sacred poet of very considerable genius. Many of his competitors
on these occasions are authors of very popular songs, but their
productions must be credited with more rhyme than poetic
power.</p>

<p>William Livingston was born in Gartmain, in Islay, in the year
1808. There are not many of his kith and kin in that island now,
nor is there any evidence that his humble progenitors were anything
else than some of those nomadic individuals or families, of a
Celto-Germanic character, unconnected particularly with any of
the well-known clans, but who, in the political economy of the
Highlands were ranged under the name of “<span lang="gd">siol Dhomhnuill</span>,” or
some other, and in latter days became more unreasonably Celtic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
in their race antipathies than the purer Celts themselves. The
late notorious Mitchell and the present leaders of the Irish Home
Rulers are Irish instances of what has been stated. The bard
Livingston is a Scottish instance; and the proximity of his native
place to Ireland’s northern coasts may have some suggestive
value, especially when his training, or rather no training, and the
sources of his historical and social knowledge are taken into consideration.
There is another Livingstone of Highland extraction—his
family were originally from Mull—who has had some connection
with Glasgow like his namesake the bard; but Dr David
Livingstone, the devoted and distinguished African traveller, turned
his attention and directed his labours to the amelioration of the
condition of Africa’s benighted and dusky children. Livingstone,
the traveller, regarded all the sons of humanity, whether they were
black or white, of whatever race, as the sons of the one great
Father, equally good and precious in his sight, and all of one
blood; but Livingston the bard devoted all his energies to the
patriotic rehearsal, in prose and verse, of the doughty deeds and
ancient prowess of our Scottish ancestors; with him the Scotsman
alone ought to occupy the position of lord of creation, especially
if it could be proved he was a Celt,—and the Englishman especially,
on account of his continual oppression of the smaller kingdom
of Scotland, he, like Irishmen of a certain order, regarded
with intense dislike, as the universal tyrant throughout the civilised
world. The bones of the distinguished traveller Dr Livingstone
were deposited in their final resting-place in Westminster Abbey
amid the sympathetic tears of all civilised nations. He was a
cosmopolitan patriot, one of the few extraordinary men whom
God vouchsafes in the progress of the ages for the enlightenment
of the dark places of the earth and the promotion of the highest
interests of universal humanity. Livingston, the bard, whose
pursuit after knowledge under unusually unfavourable conditions,
and whose indomitable perseverance and fervour of heart
were not unlike those of David Livingstone had but a very limited
vision of the functions of his mission into the world. The duties
which he assigned to himself were the magnifying of Scotland’s
fame and glory, the lashing in Wallace and Bruce fashion of the
Teutonic intruder from the south of the Tweed, and the special
vindication of the Celtic character from the continual aspersions of
the uncircumcised Saxon. He did his work with a will, but there
was no need for it. It was as uncalled for as Thomson’s work on
<em>Liberty</em>, which, undertaken in an unwise moment, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
its fine poetry, the public, not without reason, condemned to
“gather spiders and to harbour dust.” When highly needed
work goes without its reward it cannot be a matter of surprise that
unnecessary ebullitions of patriotism do not always pay; so poor
Livingston, like not a few of the order of Bards, died somewhat
neglected in an obscure street of the philanthropic city of Glasgow.
But he did not die unknown to a few sympathising friends. The
members of the Islay Association and others were always anxious
to relieve the necessities of the poet when his temper and ways
made it possible to be of some service to him. In some respects
his own independence was like that proud independence of his
native country, of which he was so fervent a singer. He died in
1870, his wife predeceasing him a few weeks.</p>

<p>Much of the character of Livingston is traceable to his upbringing.
In youth he received no education, and his earliest
training when a boy was herding cattle. Was not Rob Donn, the
Sutherlandshire Bard, also a herd? But it was thought fit to set
the embryo herd-poet to learn a trade, and he served his time at
tailoring, which he carried on in a desultory fashion all his days,
and in which he was intelligently and sympathetically assisted by
his frugal wife. He was thus a grown-up man before he got any
education, and all he ever got was self-taught; and had his pride
permitted him to tell the story of his struggles after knowledge,
English, Latin, French, Greek, and a little Hebrew, it would furnish
an interesting chapter in the annals of the pursuit of learning
under difficulties. The manuscripts of his in possession of the
writer show the extraordinary pains he took with his work—his
endeavours after a purer English style, even when well-advanced
in years—and what a long time he was a wooer of the muses before
he arrived at the intensity of poetical conception which distinguished
his later poetry. His earlier efforts do not seem to
have been very successful, and they are of a somewhat humorous
character. He almost stands alone among the prominent Gaelic
bards in having given us no love songs. The reason is that he
was probably a married man before the dormant powers of his
poetic nature awakened. While there is much tenderness in all
his descriptions of nature, the reader of his poetry must feel that
he is always surrounded by an atmosphere of martial enthusiasm
and intense patriotic sentiment. He was too wise to attempt the
singing of a passion the power of which did not evidently permeate
his nature; but the love of fatherland, the story of the
gory struggle of Scottish independence were to him all-absorbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
sources of inspiration; and to these he always turns, and finds in
them the congenial themes on which he enthusiastically lavishes
the rich poetic gifts with which he was endowed.</p>

<p>Livingston published his first volume of poetry in 1858. A
smaller volume followed a few years afterwards, in 1865; and in
1868 a few poems in pamphlet form, one of them being a prize
production—being the third piece for which he received a prize
from the Glasgow Celtic Society. The year before his death he
began to arrange his poems with a view to publishing them all in
one volume, but before he transcribed more than half a dozen of
them his pen was arrested by an invisible Power.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent10">“Death’s subtle seed within,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sly treacherous miner! working in the dark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smiled at the well-concerted scheme.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I well remember how the old bard, with his magnificent beard,
which he often stroked with evident admiration, and which seemed
to be growing up to his very eyes—small piercing eyes that
scanned the neighbours suspiciously—emphasised the hope that
when the proposed volume would appear, it would contain fully as
much first-class poetry as the works of either of the three Gaelic
modern bards, Mackay, Macintyre, or Macdonald. It is pleasant
to know that the work which the bard had so much at heart has
been accomplished under the auspices of the Islay Association,
mainly at the suggestion and with the assistance of a patriotic
countryman—Mr Colin Hay—who is a great admirer of Livingston’s
poetry.</p>

<p>The longest of Livingston’s poems is a dramatic piece entitled
<cite>The Danes in Islay</cite>. It is the only proper dramatic poem in the
language. The subject is one that the poet could take up with
much enthusiasm, as he pictured to himself the Norse army in a
fleet of sixty-three sail entering the spacious Lochindaul, and
dropping anchor there with no friendly intent. The bard’s historical
and antiquarian knowledge stood him here in good stead.
The great Macdonald, Prince of the Isles, is the central figure,
and next to him the aged but faithful Mackay of Rhinns, both
of whom are immediately informed by their watchful scouts of the
advent of those hereditary foes, the Norse invaders, on the green
shores of Islay, which was once in their own possession. The
fiery cross is sent all over the island to call together the brave
subjects of the Macdonald to defend their homes and hearths. A
battle takes place; and in the final struggle there are many heroes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
who do great and incredible deeds, chief among whom are—Nuagan
Mor, a Norse prince; Raosbun, Gilleathain Thora, and
Donncha Mor Laorain. Though this is one of the most ambitious
of Livingston’s productions, yet it is not equal as a whole, and not
so finished, nor of so high an order as, for example, his prize
poems; but the lyrical portions of it are very fine, the marching
song of Mackay of Rhinns, to the tune of <i lang="gd">Mnathan a’ Ghlinne so</i>,
being quite a gem. Here are some verses of a war chant which
occurs in the poem. The Norse invaders are supposed to rehearse
the following wild and fierce lyric as they drop anchor in the harbour
of <span class="nowrap">Lochindaul:—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The <cite>Danes in Islay</cite> is not the only <i lang="gd">cath</i> or battle that the bard
has sought to immortalise in tough classical Celtic. We have
also several vigorous poems on the battles of Scotland’s earlier
struggles for independence. Livingston’s muse is nearly wholly of
a martial order, which, while it explains his want of popularity
among what he would regard as a somewhat effeminate generation,
is the more remarkable when it is remembered how purely sentimental
the most of his contemporary bards have been. The
titles of three other poems are—<cite>The Battle of Mona Phraca</cite>, <cite>The
Battle of Dail-righ</cite>—regarded as his best—and that of <cite lang="gd">Tra-Ghruinard</cite>,
where the great Sir Lachlan MacLean of Duart fell,
pierced by the fatal shaft of the dwarf <i lang="gd">Dubh-Shee</i>, who offered
services the Knight of Duart despised. The dwarf is described
by the bard in pretty expressive terms—“<i lang="gd">Treoich a ghuir an
Diabhul ’san Lag an Diura!</i>” The best of all his poems is
the 100 lines (the number was limited) prize poem on the
achievements of the Highland regiments in the Crimean war.
There is nothing better, and not many poems equal to it in the
whole range of Celtic poetry. The best-known of his poems is
<cite lang="gd">Fios thun a’ Bhaird</cite>, or Word to the Bard, supposed to have been
sent to him in Glasgow from a farmer’s wife in Islay, the late Mrs
Blair, of Lonban, who showed much kindness to the bard when
on a visit to his native island, and whose son is the popular
minister, the Rev. Robert Blair, who was a constant friend of
Livingston, and who edited the complete edition of his works
(1881). In this delightful poem he describes in stanzas of great
beauty and tenderness the changes that have taken place, the
ruins of the depopulated districts, and the natural scenery of the
island. The following are the opening stanzas of the <i>Message to
the</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>Bard</i>:—</span></p>

<p>One of the most admired of Livingston’s poems is that on the
achievements of the Highland regiments under Sir Colin Campbell
in the Crimean War. As much of its beauty consists in a
sort of proverbial form of expression, of which the bard was a
consummate master, and in a rhythm of consonantal rhymes,
much of what is powerful in the original becomes quite prosaic
when rendered literally into English. Here is the first half of the
poem, which may indicate something of its <span class="nowrap">manner:—</span></p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">Alma.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tidings of awe came to my ear—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An ominous threat that war was near;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I saw beneath one standard there—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There thousands in their armèd might</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Panted for battle’s fierce delight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er Alma’s heights the Russians rolled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Defiant, warlike, keen, and bold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In war-array the hostile force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood there in ranks of foot and horse;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then came the order for the Gael</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Deeds sure to kindle our emotion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While earth remaineth wed to ocean.</div>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding his exceeding patriotism it cannot be said that
Livingston was either very generous or magnanimous. While
haunted with painful suspicions he allowed the canker of vindictiveness
to mar the finer elements of his nature. His envy
also rendered him almost intolerable to all his Highland literary
friends in Glasgow. But these, as one of them once remarked,
could afford to prize all that was good in the bard and overlook
his shortcomings. When this friend was dying William came to
ask his forgiveness, which he was assured he had, with the remark,
“William, my ghost will not trouble you.” This gentleman
knew the bard’s selfish motive in asking pardon, and the
superstitious reason for his so doing. Notwithstanding all this,
the man was not many days in his grave when the bard began to
attack him in a scurrilous letter in the newspapers, which, however,
was not inserted. He might be described as a Celtic
brother of Walter Savage Landor, whom he resembled in several
respects. But the sphere of life in which Livingston was born,
and his want of early education, ought to make us charitable in
our judgments of the savage element of his character. It must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
acknowledged, at the same time, that beneath the barbarian
patriotism of his nature there lay a depth of tenderness and
warmth of a grateful heart, which we discern in several of his
pieces on individual persons. There can be no doubt, also, that
many of his eccentricities arose from finding himself out of joint
in the social world, where mere patriotism or poetic talent cannot
frequently obtain the means or influence which self-conscious
spirits so hopelessly look for.</p>

<p><cite lang="gd">Blar Shunadail</cite>, a piece of considerable length and merit, was
published in <cite>The Gael</cite> after his death. The only other piece of
importance is <cite lang="gd">Driod-fhoitan Imhir an Racain</cite>, a poem of five or
six hundred lines long.</p>

<p>It ought to be mentioned that two gentlemen, one belonging to
Kintyre and the other to Cowal, were constant friends to Livingston—the
late Mr Gilchrist, printer, Glasgow, and also Mr
Duncan Whyte, of the same city. Livingston was intensely
Celtic in all his ideas and habits. He has written a good deal
of prose in English; but in that language he is like a lion in
chains. He published “A Vindication of the Celtic Character,”
a goodly volume of strong Celtic feeling and prejudice, such as
we would now expect from an Irish Celt; also, several parts of a
history of Scotland, which he did not finish, he and the publishers
having disagreed on account of the strong anti-English feeling displayed
by the writer. He swallowed the old Scottish chroniclers,
especially their anti-English prejudices, and accepted as pure truth
all that they have recorded. The Scotsman of the days of Bruce
and Wallace scarcely cherished so much of the spirit of nationality
and animosity against England as Livingston did. At the same
time there was an element of hollowness in his assumed patriotism
into which, however, he sought to thoroughly work himself,
like some others of his countrymen of the present day. It can
scarcely be denied that an element of unhealthiness prevailed in
the moral basis of his nature; but unlike many others of the
Highland poets, the smallest trace cannot be found in his works.
A few years ago a monument was erected to his memory in Janefield
Cemetery, Glasgow. Well has he described his own spirit
in the following quatrain of <span class="nowrap">Scotch:—</span></p>

<h3>NEIL MACLEOD.</h3>

<p>This author, the son of the well known <i lang="gd">Bard Sgiathanach</i>,
Donald Macleod, is undoubtedly chief among the living singers of
the Gael. Several of his songs have become very popular, such
as <cite lang="gd">An Gleann ’san robh mi Og</cite>. All his productions are characterised
by purity of style and idiom, freshness of conception
and gentleness of spirit, and liquid sweetness of versification.
His “<span lang="gd">Clarsach an Doire</span>” contains as much variety of
good popular songs as any volume of a single author in the
language. The Gaelic Society of Inverness has just appointed
him to the position of Bard to the Society in succession to Mary
Mackellar. May he long live to wear his laurels, and continue
to delight his countrymen with new songs of his native land
and people.</p>


<h3>REV. DONALD MACCALLUM.</h3>

<p>The Rev. Donald Maccallum, a native of central Argyleshire,
now a parish minister in Lewis, is the author of a small volume of
songs and poems entitled <cite lang="gd">Sop as gach Seid</cite>. His works evince a
genuine poetic spirit,—a quiet meditative mood and thoughtful
observation that so many parts of the Highlands are so well fitted
to produce and nurse. Mr Maccallum has perfect command
over the language and the “mechanic exercise” of verse; but he
will probably be more remembered in Highland history as almost
the only minister of the State Church in Scotland who had the
moral courage to stand up for the people in the struggle of the
crofter agitation in the years 1883-86.</p>


<h3>DR JOHN MACGREGOR.</h3>

<p>This writer, Surgeon-Major Macgregor, M.D., of the Bombay
Army, a native of Lewis, has kept alive the Gaelic muse for
many years in the far-off fields of Hindostan. In that land of
many languages and many races Dr Macgregor composed many
excellent lyrics in his native tongue of the Gael, and got them
printed there as well. In the midst of his honourable and
successful career, the poet’s fancies continually turn to home
scenes and dear ones left in the old country. Memories of <i lang="gd">Mairi
na h-Airidh</i>, “Mary of the Shieling,” or some others, find pleasant
embalmment in smooth-flowing verse. In 1890 appeared a
long English poem from his pen, <cite>The Girdle of the Globe</cite>, which
has been very well received by many who are well-entitled to
judge, some of the lyrics scattered throughout the cantos showing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
the spirit and power of utterance of the true poet. We look for
much more some of these days from his pen, especially when, as
he may do before long, he retires from the honourable service of
his country to cultivate the favours of the muse at home.</p>


<h3>MARY MACPHERSON.</h3>

<p>Mrs Macpherson (née Macdonald), a native of Skye, had some
bitter experiences of life some twenty years ago or more, when she
was about fifty years of age, and then her latent powers of verse-making
began to assert themselves. In recent years she has composed
largely on themes of local interest,—on the land question,
her favourites among those by whom this question has been kept
alive, and on her own personal grievances. Like Rob Donn she
has been very fortunate in having some <em>patroni</em> who have patriotically
espoused the cause of her muse and borne the expense of
publishing in excellent style her compositions. The highly competent
pens of Mr John Whyte and Mr Alexander MacBain have
helped in the production of the volume (Inverness, 1891). The
one took down the poems in correct writing from the composer’s
dictation, while the other has supplied an introductory biographical
sketch. The portraits of the poetess in various attitudes representative
of Highland home industry are a good feature of the volume.</p>

<p>If we follow the Highlander across the ocean we find him there
as fond of poetry and song as he was in his original home. The
<span class="smcap">Rev. D. B. Blair</span>, of Canada, has contributed a good deal to
Gaelic literature. He is the author of many original poems of
much merit, one on the Falls of Niagara being particularly excellent.
He has translated parts of Virgil’s Æneid from the Latin.
It was said some time ago that he had ready for the press a
Gaelic grammar and a new Gaelic version of the Psalms.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rev. A. M. Sinclair</span>, of Nova Scotia, is also a worshipper
of the muse. He, indeed, belongs to a family of bards. The
Gaels on this side are particularly indebted to Maclean Sinclair
for his valuable contributions to their literature, his last two
volumes (1890) being a handsome addition to the catalogue of
good Highland books</p>

<p>But it is not in America alone that we find the cultivation of
the Gaelic muse. If we go to New Zealand we find there <span class="smcap">Farquhar
Macdonnell</span>, once of Plockton, a composer of considerable
genius, and one of whose songs has become a popular
favourite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>It is not only in Canada and New Zealand but also in Australia
that the Gaelic muse is kept alive. Here are verses of a pretty
poem in Gaelic and English by the Rev. A. Cameron, a native
of Lochaber, from that broad continent in the Antipodes. The
author holds communion with the Ree waterfall, Nether-Lochaber,
in a <span class="nowrap">dream:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">I gaze on thee thou wondrous fall!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As I had done long years ago;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I travelled far on duty’s call</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Since last I saw thy currents flow.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In days gone by, when joy was young,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Twas my delight to sit me here;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thy grave voice, so full and strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A pleasant song was to mine ear.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Methinks I hear thy waters say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In greeting accents bathed in tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where did thy wandering footsteps stray</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These many long and weary years?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I missed thee on the rocky brink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy youthful shadow on the pool,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thou would’st say as thou would’st think</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy daily lesson for the school:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“When none but I was to thee near</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Save He who guides our weary ways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whom creation all is dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As joining in His glory’s praise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have thus seen that throughout India, America, and Australasia
we can find singers and composers of Gaelic songs, representing
leal-hearted sons of the Highlands, who have nobly served
their country, their people, and their God.</p>

    <div class="verse indentq">“O happy saints! rejoice and sing!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He quickly comes, your Lord and King!”</div>

  </div>

</div>


<p>The religious Highlander of the present day is known to be
stubbornly opposed to the use of hymns of human authorship in
public worship. His prejudice was deepened and played upon
recently in connection with a Union controversy between two
well known ecclesiastical bodies. One result has been that many
of the southern Highlanders who were in the habit of using the
translated Scripture Paraphrases have discontinued the practice.
But notwithstanding the prejudices of many Highlanders against
hymns, all the writers of sacred poetry have been very popular
among them. There were many authors of religious poetry
whose compositions did not become much known until the beginning
of this century. To this class belonged <i lang="gd">John Ban Maor</i> and
<i lang="gd">Bean a’ Bharra</i>, under whose names a good deal of verse appears
in a collection by Duncan Kennedy of Melfort, who plays a rather
unenviable part in the Ossianic controversy. The names of other
two authors also occur in the volume—Macindeor and Mackeich.
Macfadyen, a Glasgow student, published a volume of hymns in
1770, but nothing more is known of him or his work.</p>


<h3>WILLIAM MACKENZIE.</h3>

<p>This poet was born at Balvicphadrick, on the estate of Culduthel,
near Inverness. His father, who was a farmer at Borlum,
bestowed some pains on the education of William, who, after his
marriage, rented successively the farms of Bailedubh, in Tordarroch,
and that of Cnocbui, in the parish of Daviot. He afterwards
gave up farming, and was appointed by the Society for Propagating
Christian Knowledge to teach one of their schools at Leys, in
the parish of Croy, some three miles from Inverness. He laboured
there as teacher and evangelist for forty years. He died in 1838<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
at the advanced age of ninety, and was buried in the churchyard
of Dunlichity. Mackenzie appears to have been a man of fair
culture and was well read. His poetry, although <a id="tn-315">not first-class</a>,
has a masculine, sensible ring about it. A good deal of it consists
of excellent sermon matter, expressed in clear natural language
and smooth and flowing verse. Scripture history and the
usual evangelical doctrines of Christianity with an underlying
practical application, constitute his general theme. He has also
composed several elegies and addresses to persons. The poet
deals thus with a certain class of religious <span class="nowrap">professors:—</span></p>

<h3>DONALD MACRAE.</h3>

<p>If not the most powerful, this bard is certainly the keenest and
subtlest that the Highlands have produced. His father was a
native of Glenalchaig, in Kintail; but Donald was born in the
parish of Petty, Inverness-shire, the date of his birth being
11th November 1756. His parents were poor people in
humble life, and their son got no education whatever. But
Christian teaching and Biblical knowledge became a deeply cultivating
power in his case. He earned his livelihood by labouring
at his loom, when he lived as a cottager on the estate of the Earl
of Moray in his native parish of Petty. He lived to the good age
of eighty-one, his death taking place in 1837. He was buried in
the churchyard of Petty, where a small tombstone points out his
grave. He got his poems published in Inverness some time
before he died, under the title of <cite>Spiritual Songs</cite>. He has composed
a considerable quantity of poetry, the most of which is first-class
when the bard’s theme is of more than local interest. He
combines the spiritual insight and holy sympathies of George
Herbert with the subtlety of Shelley. He is the only bard that
distinctly illustrates the tendency to mysticism in Highland religion
manifested in some quarters. His profound self-analysis may
be seen the poem <span class="nowrap"><i lang="gd">Luireach</i>:—</span></p>

<h3>MARY CLARK.</h3>

<p>This poetess—<i lang="gd">Bean Torra dhamh</i>—who was the daughter
of Ewen Macpherson, schoolmaster in Laggan, Badenoch,
appears to have been a woman of great piety. She began
first to compose in English, but her husband, whose name was
Clark, persuaded her to compose in Gaelic. At the beginning of
this century she went to Inverness to get her poems, some thirty
in number, written, she herself being at that time blind, and also
to publish them. Her works appeared some time ago, anew
edited and very well translated by the Rev. John Kennedy. Mrs
Clark is a natural and intelligent singer, but without much freshness
or originality. The warmth of her religious feelings renders
her pieces more readable than they would otherwise be. She
died at Perth at an advanced age.</p>


<h3>MARGARET CAMPBELL.</h3>

<p>Margaret Campbell was born at the farm of Clashgour in
Glenorchay. Her father’s name was Peter Campbell. She
was married a second time to a Cameron at Fort-William,
when she became much reduced in circumstances. She
published a little volume of songs in 1785; a second edition,
which relieved her embarrassments a little, in 1805. Her <cite lang="gd">Laoidhean
Spioradail</cite> appeared in Edinburgh in 1810, a volume which
seems to have escaped Reid’s notice. The hymns are thirty-four
in number. An English appendix gives an abstract of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
themes with which the hymns are occupied. The metre is not
always very regular, but a few of the pieces show some poetic
vigour.</p>


<h3>REV. PETER GRANT.</h3>

<p>Next to Dugald Buchanan, the author whose hymns are best
and most widely known, is the late Peter Grant, a Baptist minister
in Strathspey, who published the first edition of his hymns as early
as 1813. As he tells us in one of his poems, he was deeply impressed
with the extent of practical heathenism among the Highlanders.
He complains, as Bishop Carsuel in the sixteenth century
did before him, that the Highlanders loved the tales of Fingal
and Ossian more than the Gospel, and that they spent all
their spare time in the recital of these vain heathen stories.
Carsuel gave his own generation a liturgy, and Grant to his a
series of Gospel hymns; and it need scarcely be asked which of
them was the more successful. The hymns became immediately
widely popular, and edition after edition was called forth, and they
have maintained their popularity to the present day. Grant is
not a powerful poet, but he is a very sweet singer. His hymns
and poems have a holy fragrance about them that is quite captivating.
The simplicity of the conception and the naturalness of
the style at once affect and enchain the heart. Grant succeeds
where a hymnist of more ambition and power would fail. The
warmth of his earnest nature is felt in every stanza he has written.
He died full of years and honours, beloved by all who knew him.
A sweet poem of his begins with the experience of a child emerging
in <span class="nowrap">heaven:—</span></p>

<h3>REV. JAMES MACGREGOR, D.D.</h3>

<p>Macgregor (1759-1830), sent by the General Associate Synod
to Nova Scotia in 1786, has written hymns (1819) which have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
been highly valued by sections of Highlanders at home and
abroad. He was a native of St. Fillans, in Perthshire, and wrote
and spoke Gaelic with greater purity and elegance than the
natives of that county in the present day are able to do. The
University of Glasgow conferred on him the degree of D.D. in
recognition of his arduous and successful labours in the Colonies
among his countrymen. His poetry, although not of the first
order, is yet sweet and natural—metrical effusions in which the
simple truths of the Gospel are rehearsed with earnestness and
freshness. The following verses are translated from his poem on
<i>The</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>Resurrection</i>:—</span></p>

<p>Macgregor’s grandson, the Rev. George Patterson, D.D., has
written his life, much of which is founded on an autobiographical
sketch.</p>

<h3>REV. JOHN MACDONALD, D.D.</h3>

<p>Dr Macdonald, of Ferintosh, as “The Apostle of the North,” is
a household word in the Highlands. As an orator, preacher,
and evangelist, no man of his day was the instrument of greater
good to his countrymen, by whom his memory will be warmly
cherished for generations. In <cite>The Gaelic Messenger</cite> (1829-30)
appeared the first and the best of his poems, which have been the
delight of more than one generation of Highlanders. This was a
poem of three parts—<cite>The Christian on his Journey to, at, and beyond
Jordan</cite>. Some of his other poems are biographical. His
poetical works were published in a neat volume in 1846. Here
are a few verses translated from the “Christian’s Journey:”—</p>

<p>The popular and living character of Macdonald’s preaching
genius is everywhere apparent in his hymns. Sweetness, elegance,
and genial, broad spiritual-mindedness, have rendered his compositions
universally pleasing. He will probably ever remain the chief
type of the Highland preacher.</p>


<h3>REV. DUNCAN MACDOUGALL.</h3>

<p>The name of this sacred bard was once very popular in the
South-West Highlands and Isles, and his memory is still green
with many aged Christians particularly in the island of Tiree,
where he laboured with success as a Nonconformist minister.
His hymns—<cite lang="gd">Laoidhean Spioradail</cite>—appeared in 1841,
and for many years continued to be great favourites in certain circles.
Macdougall and Peter Grant belong to the same order of
simple bard-evangelists who have always been a spiritually elevating
force in humble quarters where more ambitious labours have
been failures. Their productions have been sermons in verse
which the common people have received with greater gladness
than has been accorded to the more elaborate and ambitious utterances
of the regular pulpit.</p>


<h3>JOHN MORRISON.</h3>

<p>Morrison, originally a blacksmith to trade, and latterly a Free
Church catechist in Harris, is one of the most powerful and ingenious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
of the bards. I do not know in any language a poem like
his <cite lang="gd">Duin og is seann Duin’ agam</cite> in its subtlety of conception, its
felicity of expression, and its cunning weavings and turnings of
verses. Its theme is the “holy war” in the Christian soul,
which he treats not at all in the style of Bunyan, but in quite an
original fashion. It was published in 1835, again in America along
with many of his other poems. His poetry shows that he was
profoundly exercised and interested in the spiritual problems and
difficulties of the Christian life. Few men ever obtained a deeper
insight into the human heart, and fewer still possessed equally
great poetic gifts for uttering what has been seen and felt. A
good edition of his whole works is much required; and it was
once hoped that his son, Dr Morrison of Edinburgh, would satisfy
the wishes of his father’s admirers. The bard died in 1852, sixty-two
years of age, before any of his works in book-form appeared.</p>

<p>Usquba has been the theme of frequent laudations by the secular
bards; the following verses are from a preaching poem of a very
different <span class="nowrap">strain:—</span></p>

<h3>REV. DUNCAN MACCALLUM.</h3>

<p>This was an able minister of the Church of Scotland, who was
for some time settled at Arisaig. <cite lang="gd">Collath</cite> is a poem of the heroic
kind, which Mackenzie had inserted in “The Beauties” as a
specimen of ancient poetry! Mr MacCallum published it first
anonymously, as he did another booklet in which he acknowledged
himself to be the author of <cite lang="gd">Collath</cite>. His poetry shows fair poetic
gifts. We meet with MacCallum again as the author of a Church
History.</p>


<h3>REV. DUNCAN MACLEAN.</h3>

<p>The late Free Church minister of Glenorchy, Mr MacLean,
was a religious poet of great power and originality. Buchanan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
Morrison, and he are poets of the first order. The “Gaelic
Hymns” of MacLean appeared in 1868 in a small closely-printed
volume. The pieces in this volume are rather religious poems
than hymns. A keenly æsthetical spirit pervades all that MacLean
has written; and he has written more than any of the first-class
religious bards. He is exceedingly rich in poetic illustration,
and very profound in thought. He was a man of wide general
culture, and he brought the power and fruits of it with him into
the sphere of Gaelic religious poetry. But though his countrymen
highly appreciated his able ministrations in that language in the
pulpit, they do not appear to be ready to understand that they
have such a deep mine of fresh and original thought in his poetry.
The thoughtful reader, however, will at once feel that MacLean is
a man of great culture and a poet of a high order, in full sympathy
with man and the works of creation. Like Morrison of Harris,
he is too profound for the present popular taste. Here are some
translated verses of one of his best poems, on the scenery of his
native <span class="nowrap">place:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Touch gently its locks ere its glory will fade.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh fair is the vision before me outspread!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kind nature’s bright face that awakens no dread,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>MacLean was a scholarly man and possessed rich gifts for
preaching to his fellow-countrymen. His style was concise and
suggestive, his matter well-arranged and weighty, while the inspiring
spirit invested all with a heavenly force and meaning which
greatly delighted all the more thoughtful Highlanders.</p>


<h3>MINOR RELIGIOUS POETS.</h3>

<p>The Hymns of John Morrison of Skye (1828), are now scarcely
read. Others also published religious poems and hymns; but there
is none of them of any particular merit. They are just sermons
and Christian experiences put in respectable verse. They, however,
helped no doubt to propagate, especially in some parts of
the west, the earnest evangelical teaching of the authors. <cite>The
Gaelic Elegies</cite>, published in 1850 by the Rev. W. Findlater of
Durness, do not show much poetic freshness either; but owe much
of their interest to their religious character and Christian sentiments.
Two of the elegies are on Dr Macdonald of Ferintosh,
and on the Rev. A. Stewart of Cromarty. MacEachern of Eisdale
(1866) scarcely reaches mediocrity. The Rev. A. Farquharson,
a native of Perthshire, who spent the most of his life in Tiree,
also published a good deal of religious poetry, scarcely equal in
merit to Macdougall’s. He died a few years ago. The Rev.
Malcolm MacRitchie, a native of Lewis, wrote a good many
poems and hymns, which were published upwards of 30 years ago.
They are superior to those already mentioned in poetic vigour and
freshness of expression. A small volume by Cameron of Uist is
just published (1891). Hendry of Arran and D. Macdougall have
both composed a quantity of religious poetry; as also Alexander
Cook, a native of Arran, who was a lay preacher of great ability.
The writer published a poem of considerable merit by Cook in
<cite lang="gd">Bratach na Firinn</cite> in 1873. Macquarrie and Macintyre, both of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
Ross and Mull, the former a Baptist preacher and the latter a farmer,
have both composed religious poems and hymns. It would be
needless to catalogue the names of others whose names have never
taken the smallest hold of public attention. It is very remarkable
that men of powerful genius in all countries have often sunk to
mediocrity whenever the theme was purely religious. There are
not, it appears, many hymns in any language, with the exception
of the Psalms, that can be described as first-class poetry.</p>


<h3>COLLECTIONS OF RELIGIOUS POETRY.</h3>

<p>Many laudable attempts have been made to bring the power of
the sacred muse to bear on Highland life. Principal Daniel
Dewar, D.D., published a considerable collection of hymns in
1806 for public worship. It was translated wholly from English,
and consisted of paraphrases and hymns then current in the
English language. Another collection by John Munro appeared
in 1819, printed by D. Mackenzie, Glasgow. This is made up
chiefly of translations from Watts’s hymns, and many of them are
well rendered. Another appeared in 1832, published by John
Reid. This tiny volume is neatly printed, and consists mainly of
translations from the Olney hymns. Some of the compositions in
Kennedy’s collection have been referred to already. The
“Sacred Poetry of the North,” edited by John Rose, and published
in 1851, is the most valuable collection of sacred poems yet given
to the Highlanders. The authors whose works are contained in
this volume have been already brought before the reader in chronological
order. In more recent times many of the hymns of our
own day, translated by Archibald Macfadyen, Rev. Dr John MacLeod,
and others, were published by Duncan Campbell in 1874.
A new edition of the same is just published, the collection being
in request among Baptists who have always encouraged more
hymn-singing in public worship than their Presbyterian neighbours.
The latter, however, are beginning to cultivate more
liberty in this respect. A few of the hymns sung in Scotland by
Mr Sankey in 1874, were translated by the Rev. Alexander MacRae
of Clachan, and were received with much appreciation.
The first part of “The Highland Hymnal,” by the writer, was
published in 1886. In connection with Highland hymnology,
ancient and modern, Mr Lachlan MacBean, Mr Stewart of Killin,
and Mr Alexander Carmichael have done good work in exhibiting
some of the treasures of the Gaelic sacred muse. Still a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
volume of Church Praise with music has never yet been given to
the Highland Gael.</p>


<h3>SCRIPTURE PARAPHRASES.</h3>

<p>These were first translated by the Rev. Alexander Macfarlane
of Kilmelfort and Kilninver. Forty-five of them were published
in 1753. They were afterwards revised and remodelled, and
published in complete form by the Rev. John Smith, D.D., to
whom also we are indebted for the best version of the Psalter.
During the second and third generations of this century, the
Paraphrases, through no lack of life or poetic merit, fell into
disrepute in some Highland districts, particularly in the north-west,
through theological controversies in whose train rather
mechanical theories of inspiration began to be introduced. These
views, hitherto unknown among the Gaels, now followed out to
their logical issues, led to the rejection of all hymns of mere
human authorship in public worship. This result, however, is
only temporary; and in its operations confined to certain circumscribed
districts.</p>


<h3>THE PSALTER.</h3>

<p>The first fifty Psalms were published in 1684 by the Rev.
Robert Kirk of Balquidder. A version by the Synod of Argyle
appeared in 1694.</p>

<p>Several other attempts were made in the eighteenth century to
produce a good translation of the Psalms in metre, chiefly under
the auspices of the Synod of Argyle. At last there appeared in
1783 a version which has been generally received by all good
judges of Gaelic idioms and poetry as the best. The author of
this version of the Psalter was the elegant Dr John Smith, who
received the unanimous thanks of the Synod of Argyle for
“executing it in so faithful and beautiful a manner.”</p>

<p>An effort was made to force upon the Churches another translation
of the Psalter by the Rev. Dr Ross of Lochbroom, a man
of considerable ability and distinguished for his knowledge of
Gaelic. This version, however, is marred by obsolete phrases and
idioms, and has never obtained universal circulation in the Highlands.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Oft roared it out its terrors when onward pressed the foes.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p1">This was the spirit and manner in which the great poet Alex.
Macdonald went about rousing his countrymen to lofty deeds of
valour in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. He
lavished all his poetic enthusiasm on the “praises” of the national
lion, and the inspiration of his muse and of that of a hundred-others
bore fruit a century afterwards. Such poems as Macdonald’s
have had a profoundly formative influence on the minds of the
young Highlanders of our own times,—especially the more susceptible
and less sordid spirits, who would not deny their country,
race, or language for all the golden success that self-effacement as
Gaels could secure. These enduring sons of the Highlands and
Islands succeeded at last, although in the midst of much
obloquy and secular loss, in accomplishing a Gaelic revolution;—in
creating a Gaelic revival, and ultimately a powerful agitation
that bore a fruit that has justified the more sanguine expectations
and claims of bards and patriots. This has been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
fruit of a century of Gaelic effort devoted to the study of the language,
history, and interests of the people. While the foes of such
an endeavour have been numerous and supercilious, even in selfish
Highland quarters, let it not be forgotten that a great deal of sympathy
and practical help came from many kindly hearts and hands
among our Lowland fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>It is interesting to trace the influences that have brought about
this bloodless revolution in the Highlands, some of whose people a
little over a century ago were engaged in rebellion against the
present dynasty. A healthy form of Christianity and common
sense have done it all. The meaning of the one came to them
through the translation of good religious writings and the Gaelic
Bible: and the exercise of the other became possible through the
instructed good qualities of the Highlanders themselves. I therefore
in this last chapter devote some paragraphs to the results
that the chief forms of Gaelic endeavour have produced.</p>


<h3>THE GAELIC BIBLE.</h3>

<p>The first portion of the Bible translated was the New Testament,
in 1767, by the Rev. James Stewart of Killin. Dugald Buchanan,
the poet, accompanied Mr Stewart to Edinburgh to superintend
the work through the press. The title-page bears that the translation
was undertaken at the request and at the expense of the
Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge. The
translator adopted an orthographical system, which has been perfected
into a standard of Gaelic by succeeding scholars. The first
edition of the translation of the Old Testament was published in
the following order:—</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
Part I., 1783, translated by John Stuart, D.D., of Luss.<br>
Part IV., 1786, translated by John Smith, D.D., of Campbelton.<br>
Part II., 1787, translated by Dr Stuart.<br>
Part III., 1801, translated by Dr Stuart.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">The fourth part, assigned to Dr Smith, contained the Prophets,
which had afterwards to be revised, Smith’s version being more
poetical than literal. Dr Stuart was a son of the translator of the
New Testament, and received in 1819 for his labours in connection
with the first and other editions of the Gaelic Scriptures the
sum of £1000 from the Lords of the Treasury, a Government
favour which has not been always recognised. A new and revised
edition on which Dr Alexander Stewart, of Dingwall, was engaged
with Dr Stuart, of Luss, under the instructions of a large committee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
of Gaelic scholars appointed by the General Assembly in
1816, was published in quarto in 1826. It is acknowledged by
all competent judges that this Gaelic version of the Scriptures is
beyond all praise; that in many instances it adheres more closely
to the original than the English Bible, whose beauty and excellence
have won universal admiration. The translation of the Old
Testament was also undertaken at the expense of the Society for
Propagating Christian Knowledge, and through its liberality the
Scriptures were sold at half the cost price. On the publication
of the Revised Version of the English Bible, a committee of
Gaelic scholars undertook the revision of the Gaelic Bible; but on
account of some difficulties with the Society for Propagating
Christian Knowledge the fruit of their labours has not yet appeared.</p>


<h3>TRANSLATIONS INTO GAELIC.</h3>

<p>It is mostly religious works of the Evangelical and Puritan type
that have been translated into Gaelic. The masterpieces of
Bunyan, Brooks, Baxter, Burder, Owen, Howe, Doddridge, Alleine,
etc. etc., have been rendered into good, popular Gaelic, and
have had immense circulation. Hundreds of religious works have
been translated, some as old as <cite>The Imitation</cite>, and as recent as
Newman Hall’s <cite>Come to Jesus</cite>. The principal translators have
been the Macfarlanes, Dr Smith, MacLaurin, Rose, Dr Macgillivray,
Dr Mackintosh Mackay, the Rev. Allan Sinclair, and the
Rev. A. Macgregor, translator of the Apocrypha. It was MacEachen,
a Roman Catholic priest, that translated <cite>The Imitation</cite>.
Several books of Homer’s <cite>Iliad</cite> were translated <a id="tn-328">by the accomplished</a>
Ewen MacLachlan of Aberdeen; Virgil’s Æneid by
Blair; and <cite>Tam O’Shanter</cite> and other poems by Robert MacDougall,
the bard. As is well known, the Queen’s Book has been
translated into excellent Gaelic by Mary Mackellar. The Good
Templar and Masonic rituals were, with the help of the present
writer, translated by Duncan Macpherson and Angus Nicholson
respectively. Not the least important of recent efforts of this
kind is the admirable translation of that great Highland charter
of Gaelic emancipation, the Crofters’ Act, from the able and
accurate pen of Mr Henry Whyte.</p>


<h3>TRANSLATIONS INTO ENGLISH.</h3>

<p>A good deal of Gaelic literature has been translated into English,
whilst the “Ossian” of Macpherson has been rendered into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
Latin and into most of the European languages. Following is a
list of the names of those who have published anything of <span class="nowrap">importance:—</span></p>

</table>

<p>The names of some others, such as Sinclair, the Whytes
MacBean, etc., will occur to the Gaelic reader. The works
translated by these writers would fill many volumes. The
works of Macpherson, Dr Smith, Dr MacLauchlan, J. F.
Campbell, Thomas Pattison, Dr Clerk, and Professor Blackie
have received much attention, and are well-known. Macpherson
and Smith translate, on the supposition of translation,
very much in the style of Pope in his Homer with
this difference, that their paraphrastic renderings are only
in prose. MacLauchlan, Campbell, and Clerk have adopted
a rigid literality of rendering which the Ossianic controversy,
among other reasons, compelled them to follow. These
writers give the original <a id="tn-329">Gaelic along with</a> the English version.
So does Jerram, whose <cite lang="gd">Dan an Deirg</cite> is scholarly and
accurate, very much in the style of Clerk’s <cite>Ossian</cite>. In the <cite>Gaelic
Bards</cite> of Pattison the original is not given, the work being intended
for popular use among English readers. Pattison’s translations
are metrical and rhyming; and so are Blackie’s in his admirable
and interesting work, <cite>The Language and Literature of the
Scottish Highlands</cite>. Those to whom the Gaelic is a sealed language
have kindled the flame of patriotic enthusiasm by the
healthy mountain breezes which the perusal of these translations
has brought down.</p>


<h3>GRAMMARS AND DICTIONARIES.</h3>

<p>Several good grammars and dictionaries have been published.
Shaw, towards the end of last century, published a grammar and
dictionary which are not of much value. Stewart’s Grammar in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
1812 is still the best, and any new grammar must take Stewart’s as
a basis. Currie, MacAlpine, Forbes, and Munro have also published
grammars. Munro’s is a work of real scholarship and
value, but badly arranged. Dr Macgillivray and L. MacBean
have also written grammars, but the best of all recent attempts is
that published by the late D. C. Macpherson, Edinburgh. Good
grammars have also been written by Irishmen, and even Germans,
from which much help may be obtained. The vocabularies
of Macdonald and Macfarlane paved the way for the Highland
Society’s Dictionary, published in 1828, a noble monument
of Gaelic talent and industry. It appeared in two large
volumes. Its departments are—Gaelic, English, and Latin; Anglo-Gaelic,
Latino-Gaelic. There are 837 pages in the first volume,
and 1016 in the second. The general conduct of the work was
entrusted to the Rev. Dr John MacLeod of Dundonald. He was
assisted by the Rev. Drs Irvine, Macdonald, and Ewan MacLachlan.
In its progress through the press the work was carefully
superintended and corrected by the Rev. Dr Mackintosh Mackay.
None of the Celtic languages can boast of so extensive and
learned a lexicon, although it is defective in etymology, the science
of language being then only in its infancy. Armstrong and MacAlpine
have also produced excellent and useful dictionaries. That
of the former is not much inferior to that of the Highland Society’s,
while MacAlpine’s has perhaps been the most successful of all.
The indefatigable labours of the Macfarlanes, father and son,
have been placed to the credit of Drs MacLeod and Dewar, whose
names were thought a necessary guarantee by the publisher that
their dictionary was of standard value. Theirs and MacAlpine’s
are in general circulation. That of the latter is a pronouncing
dictionary, and has been highly appreciated by those anxious to
acquire the language. The translations of phrases and idiomatic
expressions under the principal words are acknowledged to be a
chief excellence of the work. The English-Gaelic part of MacAlpine’s
dictionary was compiled by John Mackenzie, editor of
“The Beauties of Gaelic Poetry,” who had some peculiar ideas of
reform in Gaelic orthography. He was heartily execrated by the
irascible MacAlpine for his labour, which was no doubt a hack
business undertaken for publishers whom Mackenzie could not
control. A good deal of material for an etymological dictionary
was left by the late Dr Alexander Cameron of Brodick, the publication
of which is looked for under the editorial care of Mr Alex.
MacBain, M.A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>


<h3>PROSE WRITERS.</h3>

<p>The number of Gaelic prose writers is very limited. This fact
is the result of various causes on the surface of things. Till the
beginning of this century the vast masses of the Highland people
were utterly unable to read, and even those who were able
to make use of books turned to English productions sooner than
to Gaelic ones, a tendency that is not invisible even in our own
day. All that the plain Highlander has been able to consume in
the way of literature he has found in the Book of Books—the Bible—and
in the many translations of religious literature placed within
his reach. Families and individuals destitute of the spiritual instinct
have found all the literary sustenance needed in the old popular
tales and poetry which circulated from mouth to mouth rather
than in written forms. To the Finian tales and similar stuff the
Highlanders of the nineteenth century were till recently as partial
as those of the sixteenth century were to the oral literature of the
same pagan character against which Superintendent Carsuel raised
his ineffectual protest at the time of the Reformation. This oral
form of literature required neither money nor ability to read for
its enjoyment; while the manner of its culture helped to relieve
the weariness and monotony of Highland life. Literature in
books, which meant money, was therefore at a discount.</p>

<p>But to the great credit of sagacious patriots of the Presbyterian
Church of Scotland, efforts were continually made to teach the
people to read and to circulate healthy literature. The Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge rendered splendid services in
both respects, as did also in later times the circulating Gaelic-School
teachers, whose labours early in this century converted
many a dreary moral wilderness into fair fields of spiritual life.
Similar excellent work has been accomplished by the Ladies’ Associations
of Edinburgh and Glasgow during the last forty years.
And now at last well-trained teachers are to be found in Board
Schools established by the national system of education introduced
by the Act of 1872, under which the good old parish schools have
vanished. But with all these revolutionary changes there is no
adequate encouragement yet afforded to the teaching of Gaelic,
which a prejudiced Government Department in London feels reluctant
at heart to acknowledge. This state of matters is a sufficient
explanation of the fact that our Gaelic prose literature is so
scanty, and that the writers of it have received so little reward for
their patriotic labours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>In the following paragraphs will be found the names of the
most of those who are the authors of volumes of Gaelic prose, or
who are otherwise recognised as having contributed considerably
to our prose literature:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Hugh Macdiarmid.</span>—This well known minister of Callander
is the author of a goodly volume of sermons which have
had a fair circulation in the South Highlands. They exhibit no
special ability in the author, but are plain common-sense productions
which would not rouse much holy enthusiasm in the reader,
nor make serious demands on his intellect. At the same time
they were often in request in pious homes, where, on the poor
man’s great Day of Rest, they might be brought forth to be read.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Principal Daniel Dewar</span>, D.D.—Though the Principal of a
Scottish University, Dr Dewar did not allow himself to get contemptuous
towards the language of his forefathers like many much
smaller men when they get into posts of honour. As pointed out
elsewhere, Dewar published early in the century a fair collection
of Gaelic hymns, the preface to which shows him to be a man of
culture and devout spirit. We find his name also associated with
a popular dictionary, and with all enterprises of his time for the
uplifting of Gaelic life. “The Gaelic Preacher,” a booklet by Dr
Dewar, is well-known to the present generation of Gaelic readers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. John Macmillan.</span>—This Arran preacher was one of the
ablest men who occupied Gaelic pulpits in the early part of this
century. The unction and power of his sermons are still remembered
by old folks in his native island, where his labours have
been highly esteemed and loved. “Macmillan’s Sermons” is a
posthumous volume issued under the editorial care of his relative,
the Rev. Mr Stewart, who in their publication has conferred a boon
on his Highland fellow-countrymen. The founders of the great
publishing house of Macmillan were not unrelated to the distinguished
preacher of these sermons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Mackintosh Mackay</span>, LL.D.—This Sutherlandshire divine
was the most distinguished and thorough Gaelic scholar of
his time. He collected and edited Rob Donn’s poems, no small
achievement in itself; had a prodigious share in the production of
the Highland Society’s Dictionary, and published the <cite lang="gd">Fianuis</cite> at
the time of the Disruption of the Scottish Establishment—a monument
of good Gaelic prose and powerful exposition of great principles
in the language of the Gael. The pages of the <cite lang="gd">Fianuis</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
however, being largely controversial, they are now very much forgotten
like the many pamphlets which the Union controversy
subsequently brought forth. For many years Dr Mackay was one
of the best-known ministers of the Scottish Churches at home and
abroad. In Australia he helped divided Presbyterians to unite,
but on his return home in his old age he opposed a similar union
in Scotland. He kept up his interest in Gaelic studies to the very
last, and his love of accuracy continued to the end. Mr William
Mackenzie, publisher, of Glasgow, engaged him to write a Gaelic
Church History (1872), which in his last years he accomplished
with all the care and scholarship which distinguished his work
for the great Gaelic dictionary in his younger years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Alexander Beith</span>, D.D.—This remarkable divine has
only recently passed away over ninety years of age. As early as
1824 he published a little book on “Baptism” when he was
minister at Oban. It is interesting as being one of our earliest
original prose works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Norman Macleod</span>, D.D.—Well has Dr Macleod been
styled “The Highlander’s Friend,” for no Gaelic man of eminence
has ever identified himself with his countrymen more
thoroughly than he. The favourite of Royalty, the personal
friend of Sir Robert Peel, few men of his cloth have ever received
more public honour and respect; and his no less famous
son found a people, when he came forward publicly, affectionately
ready to welcome him. It is as a powerful writer of Gaelic prose,
however, that the elder Norman will be remembered. His writings
are full of wit, wisdom, and humour, and will be read by
Highlanders as long as Gaelic continues to be spoken. No other
man has fashioned by his literary efforts the mental habits of his
countrymen so much as he. He has been the Dickens (<em>plus</em>
powerful religious feelings) of the Highlands. No Highlander ever
knew better than he how to touch the heart-chords of his country
men. In many of his labours he had a worthy and scarcely less
able co-adjutor in his brother, the Rev. Dr John Macleod of
Morven. His works were collected, edited, and republished by
his accomplished relative, the Rev. Dr Clerk of Kilmallie.</p>

<p>Macleod’s <cite lang="gd">Leabhar nan Cnoc</cite> became their first introduction to
Gaelic literature to thousands of Highlanders who never lost the
first impressions it left on their minds in youth. The first volume
of the <cite>Gaelic Messenger</cite> for 1830 was condemned by some as
too light and racy; the second and last for 1831 received so little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
support that the magazine was stopped. The late Mr W. R.
MacPhun, the publisher, informed the writer, in 1873, that the
parcels of “Messengers” sent to the Highlands and Islands came
back at the end of the year, <em>after they had been read</em>, without any
accompanying payment, of course. Dr Macleod and his enterprising
publisher saw then that it was time to give up the business.
Some who have lost time and money in recent times over Gaelic
affairs may find some cold comfort in this incident in the experience
of our greatest of prose writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Mackenzie.</span>—The compiler of “The Beauties of Gaelic
Poetry” wrote largely in prose, for which he had great natural
gifts. He was the author of an admirable “History of Prince
Charles,” in which much easy and idiomatic Gaelic will be found.
His other works of “The Beauties,” “The English-Gaelic Dictionary,”
“The Gaelic Melodist,” etc., are so well-known that no
further description of them is necessary. The late Gaelic publishers,
Maclachlan &amp; Stewart of Edinburgh, employed Mackenzie
on various works for years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Duncan MacCallum.</span>—This Arisaig minister has come
before us already as the author of <cite lang="gd">Collath</cite>, once sent forth as an
ancient heroic poem. He is better known as the author of a
Gaelic Church History, which is written with fair ability. This
has at least <a id="tn-334">the distinction of</a> being the first of the kind in the
language.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. John Forbes.</span>—The author of the “Double Grammar”
(Gaelic and English in parallel columns), second edition (1848),
was a very clever and a very learned Highlander. He translated
much into Gaelic, in which he wrote with purity and ease. He
was very ingenious in coining new terms for conceptions hitherto
alien to Gaelic. He and Munro having no access to the works of
the ancient writers of the Celtic Missions Churches described
by Zeuss became thus needlessly neologists. Forbes’s <cite lang="gd">Lochran</cite>,
<cite lang="gd">Long Gheal</cite>, etc., are well-known to the readers of Gaelic religious
literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Archibald Clerk</span>, LL.D.—Dr Clerk’s greatest work is
the elaborate edition of Macpherson’s Ossian (1870), with new
translations and notes, and Macpherson’s original prose version
running at the foot of the pages. All that Celtic culture and
accurate knowledge of Gaelic could do for the Gaelic of 1807
Clerk has done; and the splendid work, in two volumes, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
published at the expense of the generous Marquis of Bute. But
all to no avail; for I find, just as write, that even Professor
Mackinnon at last has given up the old faith in Ossian. Dr
Clerk’s prose writings were numerous as editor and contributor
in connection with periodical literature. He, in conjunction
with Dr MacLauchlan, undertook the revision of the Gaelic Bible,
but with results rather unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Thomas MacLauchlan</span>, LL.D.—A very difficult task
was taken in hand by MacLauchlan when he undertook the transcription
and modernisation of the MS. and Gaelic of the Dean of
Lismore’s Book. This work he also translated literally into
English. He, too, edited Macpherson’s Gaelic Ossian, the small
edition in circulation having been issued under his care. Like Dr
Clerk he had a hand in and helped various Gaelic enterprises of
his time. Among others he had charge of the new edition of
Carsuel’s Liturgy. His “Celtic Gleanings” (1857), and “Review
of Gaelic Literature” (1872) in Fullarton’s work on the Highlands
and Highland Clans, were the first attempts to give us an account
of the literature of the Gael. His “Early Scottish Church” was a
creditable production, considering the limited materials which
were then available for the general historian’s purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Angus Mackenzie.</span>—Mr Mackenzie, a native of Lewis,
has the honour of being the only man who has ever attempted to
write a complete history of Scotland in Albin’s ancient tongue.
His <cite lang="gd">Eachdraïdh na h-Alba</cite> (1867) is written with much ability
and in good idiomatic Gaelic. It covers the whole period of
Scottish story, and ought to have an extensive circulation among
Highlanders. But it is feared that although sold very cheaply it
had not the sale it so well deserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Alexander Macgregor.</span>—This excellent and patriotic
“<span lang="gd">Sgiathanach</span>” was among the best story-tellers of his age, ranking
probably, as far as that gift is concerned, next to Norman
Macleod. Tales and sketches on almost everything Highland
were continually pouring from his facile pen for many years.
His translation of the Apocrypha, undertaken at Lucien Bonaparte’s
request, will remain a fine monument of his knowledge of
his native tongue. The Gaelic Society of Inverness and <cite>The
Celtic Magazine</cite> were much indebted to him during the first years
of their existence. When he died he was minister of the West
(Established) Church of Inverness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Alexander Cameron</span>, LL.D.—No one in this generation
has contributed so much towards accurate Gaelic scholarship as
the late Free Church minister of Brodick. He taught Gaelic with
great success for years at Glasgow University to scores of Highland
students who, but for his enthusiasm and self-denying labours,
would be settling in Highland pastorates with more than enough
of Latin and Greek and Hebrew but quite ignorant of Gaelic
grammar. The more learned products of Dr Cameron’s pen were
published in the <cite>Scottish Celtic Review</cite> begun in 1880. This
periodical was chiefly written by himself and largely filled with
philology. Mr MacBain of Inverness is understood to be preparing
for the press the materials left behind by Dr Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. John George MacNeill.</span>—The Free Church minister of
Cawdor began writing Gaelic articles while still a student in 1873.
He contributed a large proportion of the general contents of two
volumes of <cite lang="gd">Bratach na Firinn</cite> in which also a telling short story,
<cite lang="gd">Tighnacloiche</cite> appeared from his pen. <cite lang="gd">An Soisgeul ann an
India</cite> (1888) is a living, natural and idiomatic translation of Miss
Rainy’s admirable volume on the Gospel in India. This is one of
the most interesting, books in the language the reader finding here
the life and customs of Aryans in the East described in the ancient
tongue of Aryans in the extreme West of Europe, the children of
Sanscrit and of Celtic being once more brought there into close
contact. Mr MacNeill has edited the Free Church Gaelic Quarterly
with much spirit and success for some years. The Gaelic
preface to the <cite lang="gd">Oranaiche</cite> and a biographical sketch and notes to
<a id="tn-336">the second edition</a> of “Pattison’s Gaelic Bards” are from his pen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Donald Mackinnon</span>, M.A.—After ages of unreasonable
neglect of the Gaelic language, it is satisfactory to Gaels at
last to be able to point to the Celtic Chair in Edinburgh University
as an academic recognition of its claims; and it is not less
satisfactory to know that the first occupant of the Chair is a scholar
well fitted to adorn the position. Professor Mackinnon’s first
contributions to the literature of his native language appeared in
<cite>The Gael</cite>, and showed that the native ability and culture which
secured him recognition in other spheres of study might be of
exceptional service to Gaelic literature. Mr Mackinnon has published
a text-book for the use of his class; and has contributed
more than one series of fresh and delightful articles to the columns
of <cite>The Scotsman</cite>, which will no doubt appear some day in a more
permanent form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. William Ross.</span>—Coming early under the influence of Dr
MacLauchlan, Mr Ross, in the midst of much public work and
various activities, has carried on his Gaelic studies and Celtic researches,
which have been of a careful and extensive character.
He has taught with success a Gaelic class, and lectured on Gaelic
literature for many years at the Free Church College, Glasgow.
He has also rendered a good deal of public service in connection
with Highland education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Robert Blair</span>, D.D.—This able and popular minister of
the Church of Scotland has contributed very largely to our Celtic
periodicals, delivered many delightful Gaelic lectures, and has in
various ways heartily promoted the cultivation of the Gaelic language.
He has edited an edition of the poetical works of Livingston,
and supplied a good biographical sketch of the bard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Whyte.</span>—“<span lang="gd">Fionn</span>” is well-known to the Gaelic-reading
public at home and abroad as a clever and industrious Anglo-Gaelic
journalist. A volume of Gaelic-English and English-Gaelic
metrical translations, “The Celtic Garland” (1881), <a id="tn-337">has
had a very</a> good circulation. In prose and verse, in English
and Gaelic, Mr Whyte shows great versatility and considerable
culture; while his knowledge of the music, manners, and life of
the Highlanders is extensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Whyte.</span>—Although his name is attached to no special
volume, Mr Whyte has for many years been recognised as one of
our ablest Gaelic scholars. He writes with elegance and accuracy
in both languages, and, like his brother Henry, is well able to
express himself in verse as well as in prose. He wrote largely
for <cite>The Gael</cite>, <cite>The Highlander</cite>, etc.; while recently he transcribed
for the press the poems and songs of Mrs Macpherson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lachlan MacBean.</span>—MacBean’s <cite>Lessons in Gaelic</cite> has been
perhaps the most popular of all the helps provided for the student
anxious to acquire the language. The author has for many
years been a successful journalist, but in the midst of his professional
duties he has found time to produce some remarkable
works, particularly translations from such standard authors as
Dugald Buchanan, etc. Mr MacBean is equally at home in the
use of the Gaelic and English languages, and it ought to be said
that his translations have the desirable quality of being readable in
their English dress. Perhaps the fact ought not to be omitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
that his works have been published by a gentleman who has
shown considerable enterprise for many years in connection with
Gaelic publications—Mr John Noble of Inverness.</p>

<p>The list of those known as fair writers of Gaelic prose is now
well-nigh exhausted. Mackellar, Dugald Macphail, and others
whose names appear in other chapters might also be described as
prose writers. Among others the following also may be mentioned
as having used a Gaelic pen with varying successes:—</p>

<p><em>Rev. Neil Dewar</em> of Kingussie is an able and accurate Gaelic
scholar, who helped in the publication of an edition of the Gaelic
Bible with references.</p>

<p>The <em>Rev. D. M. Connell</em> is the author of a little treatise on
astronomy published more than forty years ago.</p>

<p><em>Dr D. Black</em> of Poolewe published a booklet on medicine and
nursing in 1877 which is well written and full of valuable knowledge
and guidance.</p>

<p><em>Dr Morrison</em> of Edinburgh, son of the sacred bard of Harris,
wrote for some time a good deal for the columns of <cite>The Gael</cite>.</p>

<p>The <em>Rev. John MacRury</em> has supplied in excellent style much of
the Gaelic Supplement to <cite>Life and Work</cite>, the organ of the Established
Church. He has also written well versions of some ancient
Gaelic tales.</p>

<p><em>Dr John Clerk</em> has exercised his able and ingenious pen in
verse and prose products of various kinds.</p>

<p><em>Dr Hugh Cameron Gillies</em>, another gentleman of the same profession,
author of a small Grammar and Text-book, is at home
in the use of the Gaelic language, and has edited some poetry and
music.</p>

<p><em>Malcolm Macfarlan</em>, the author of a little interesting work of
Gaelic Phonetics, has written a good deal in Gaelic with care
and fair accuracy.</p>

<p>The <em>Rev. James Dewar</em>, late of Oa, Islay, produced quite a
unique little work, and one of some ability—a Gaelic reply to the
celebrated “Claim and Protest” of the Free Church of Scotland.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There may be some small productions of merit, such as a Sermon
by the <em>Rev. Archibald Cook</em>, and similar publications, which
are unnoticed here; but I do not think that many works of any
importance have escaped reference. As already mentioned in
another chapter, the Gaelic is cultivated in Canada as at home.
We are all familiar with the name of the Rev. D. B. Blair, but
there have been many others in the Dominion who have laboured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
to keep the flame of Gaelic literature alive. Patrick Macgregor
the well-known barrister, was one of them; and the name of Dr
Neil MacNish reminds us that there are not a few even now—men
of ability and patriotic spirit—who strenuously uphold the interests
of Albin’s ancient tongue.</p>


<h3>PERIODICALS.</h3>

<p>Strenuous efforts were put forth early in this century to supply
the Highlanders with useful literature in their own tongue, but
the necessary sustained support has not hitherto been accorded to
such efforts. Popular poetry and religious writings have therefore
been the main channels through which literature has reached
the Gaelic mind. The following list embraces the chief publications
of this kind:—</p>

<p>In 1803 the <cite lang="gd">Ros-Roine</cite>, a magazine, commenced, but the publication
ceased with the fourth number.</p>

<p>In 1829-31 <cite lang="gd">An Teachdaire Gaidhealach</cite>, a monthly, was sent
forth by W. R. MacPhun, publisher, Glasgow, with the elder Dr
Norman Macleod as editor.</p>

<p>In 1835-36 <cite lang="gd">An Teachdaire Ur Gaidhealach</cite> was published.</p>

<p>In 1840-43 <cite lang="gd">Cuiartear nan Gleann</cite> appeared, with Dr Macleod
once more as chief support and editor.</p>

<p>In 1848 <cite lang="gd">Fear-tathaich nam Beann</cite> made its appearance only to
succumb, like its predecessors, after a brief existence.</p>

<p>Some of the writers associated with these efforts were Lachlan
Maclean, Archibald Sinclair, Campbell (the Glasgow publisher),
and the late Rev. Dr Archibald Clerk of Kilmallie.</p>

<p>The Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843 became the
chief theme of an ably conducted periodical, <cite lang="gd">An Fhianuis</cite>, edited
by the Rev. Dr Mackintosh Mackay.</p>

<p>Even in Canada attempts were made to keep the Gaelic alive
by means of magazine literature. Between 1840 and 1841
Urquhart published in Canada <cite lang="gd">Cuairtear nan Coiltean</cite>; and
about 1851 John Boyd published <cite lang="gd">An Cuairtear Og</cite> in Antigonish,
N.S.</p>

<p>For many years afterwards no efforts were made to publish
magazines till 1871, when Mr Angus Nicholson, a native of Lewis,
published in Canada the first three numbers of <cite lang="gd">An Gaidheal</cite>
(<span class="smcap">The Gael</span>). On the advice of some Celtic friends the spirited
projector of this venture transplanted his young sapling into
Scottish soil in 1872, where it continued to appear for about six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
years. In 1872-4 <cite lang="gd">Bratach na Firinn</cite>, chiefly a religious magazine,
appeared, published by the writer in his undergraduate days.</p>

<p>At present the Church of Scotland’s own organ of “Life and
Work” has a <cite>Gaelic Supplement</cite>. The Free Church issues <cite>The
Gaelic Record</cite>. Gaelic articles have also appeared in the newspapers
of Inverness and Oban, editors having discovered
of late years that the insertion of Gaelic articles is not inimical to
the circulation of their journals. <cite>The Celtic Magazine</cite>, ably
carried on for some years by Mr Alexander Mackenzie, and the
<cite>Highland Monthly</cite> at present, though not written in Gaelic, have
helped forward Gaelic scholarship. Nor must I omit to mention
the earlier patriotic efforts of Mr John Murdoch in <cite>The Highlander</cite>,
in writing the language and advocating its claims—efforts which
ought to find a special place in the pages of the historian of the
Gaelic Renaissance of this quarter of the nineteenth century.</p>


<h3>HIGHLAND SOCIETIES.</h3>

<p>The Highland Societies of London and Scotland have contributed
materially towards the cultivation of Celtic literature, although
the latter for more than half a century has developed into
a merely agricultural association. The Scottish one has given us
the learned “<span class="smcap">Report</span>” on the Ossianic literature, which Henry
Mackenzie, author of “The Man of Feeling,” edited as well as
the magnificent Dictionary already described. The London
Society helped to give Smith’s <cite lang="gd">Seann Dana</cite> to the world more
than a century ago, and Patrick Macgregor’s <cite>Genuine Remains</cite> of
Ossian in 1840. Ibis Society still flourishes under royal and
aristocratic smiles in London, and in recent years, under the guidance
of Dr Farquhar Matheson, Dr Roderick Macdonald, M.P.,
and others, has helped many Highland youths with bursaries to
enable them to obtain University training. The Gaelic Society
of London was formed in the year 1777, and is still rejoicing in a
vigorous manhood. In those days there were many Gaelic
patriots about the metropolis who had made considerable fortunes
abroad and in the south; and they felt it a sacred duty to encourage
organisations which might nurse the apparently decaying
spirit of the threatened Scottish nationality. Some twenty years
ago the Gaelic Society of Inverness was formed, and to it the Celtic
world is indebted for a series of annual volumes of Transactions
in which we have materials for a rich museum of folk-lore, poetry,
tradition, history, philology, etc. These volumes will be of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
utmost value for the future student. Two names deserve special
mention in connection with these volumes—that of Mr William
Mackenzie, Principal Clerk of the Highland Land Court, a gentleman
who wields a facile pen in both Gaelic and English; and that
of Mr William Mackay, solicitor, Inverness, who is among the
most distinguished archæological lawyers in the country, and who
has furnished contributions of the highest value to these volumes.</p>

<p>The Gaels of Glasgow more recently formed a Gaelic Society,
of which Mr Magnus Maclean, M.A. of Glasgow University, is
the admirable secretary. This Society has made a good beginning
with the publication of the first volume of its Transactions lately
published. Perth and other large towns have also their Gaelic
Societies in this country, and if we look across the Atlantic we
find quite a large number of them in Canada. The Gaelic
Society of Toronto, of which a distinguished native of Islay—Mr
David Spence—has been a moving spirit, is in a very flourishing
condition.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the great political change which has just come over the
dreams of Highlanders the Gaelic language has been of the most
undoubted service. Indeed it is through its judicious use as a
political weapon that this change was brought to a successful pass
in 1886. It was the thousands of the Gaelic Land-Law Reform
manifestoes sent forth from London in 1883-4, that organised the
Highlands and Islands for the brilliant Parliamentary triumph of
1885, by which the first practical fruits of the Gaelic revival were
reaped. And here it may be interesting to preserve a copy of one
of these manifestoes, which played so prominent a part in bringing
about the Imperial recognition of Highland rights. The following
prose paragraphs may be referred to as a specimen of the
Gaelic of the period as well as a monument of the services rendered
by the use of Gaelic in an important national <span class="nowrap">crisis:—</span></p>

<h3>HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY.</h3>

<p>The earlier labours of many Highlanders in these fields are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
now of so much value, but a similar remark is equally applicable
to those whose names are associated with other peoples and their
history. The results of such efforts as these are certainly not
Gaelic literature, but they are referred to here as kindred and indispensable
in understanding it. Such books as Grant “On the
Descent of the Gael” and Logan’s “Scottish Gael” remind us of
the earlier periods, while we are able to point to Skene’s monumental
work “Celtic Scotland” as embodying the fruits of the
Gaelic learning of our generation. The “Antiquarian Notes”
and other excellent productions from the pen of Mr Fraser-Mackintosh,
M.P., show that some of our legislators in these
times take a living and hearty interest in the annals of their ancestors.
That splendid series of publications, “The Historians
of Scotland,” the Celtic student will find a much-prized possession;
and the series of volumes the Rhind Lecturers have given
us will be felt to be equally valuable. Gregory, Browne (supplemented
by Keltie), and others have written on general Highland
history and the achievements of the Highland regiments. And a
large number of writers have published important works on county
and clan histories.</p>

<p>Among those who have published clan histories the name that
undoubtedly stands highest is that of the indefatigable Mr
Alexander Mackenzie of Inverness, whose labours in this field are
quite gigantic. He has produced many large and interesting volumes
on some of the chief clans, and the fulness and accuracy of them
are acknowledged by those most competent to judge. In this
field Mr Mackenzie stands head and shoulders above all his
fellows. As projector and editor of the <cite>Celtic Magazine</cite> first, and
subsequently of the <cite>Scottish Highlander</cite>, he has supplied his
countrymen with an immense mass of Highland lore of every description.</p>

<p>Very interesting volumes of Celtic waifs and strays, Gaelic tales,
and folk-lore have been published by Mr Nutt, London; and to
these have been contributed exceedingly valuable notes by Mr
Alfred Nutt. The material for these volumes has been supplied
by able ministers of the Church of Scotland—the Rev. Mr MacInnes,
Rev. J. G. Campbell of Tiree, and the Rev. Mr Macdougall
of Duror. The name that stands highest in this sphere of
folk-lore is undoubtedly that of the Rev. Alexander Stewart, LL.D.,
the well-known and accomplished “Nether Lochaber,” whose gifted
pen has shed the lustre of literary beauty on all it has touched.
Dr Stewart’s powers are as versatile as they are original and full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
the patriotic spirit. For more than a generation he has poured
forth rich contributions in poetic prose and in verse, in English
and in Gaelic, on natural history, literature, and folk-lore.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the preceding chapters an attempt has been made to point
out the value of the literary treasures which lie enshrined in the
Gaelic language, as well as the fact that no previous age has witnessed
more Celtic activity than the present, and that the tongue
of Ossian is still a subject of fond use and devotion with many.
As an interesting proof of this the following verses may be appropriately
introduced as a Gaelic close to the volume; and in
relation to them it may be stated that they were first sung in a
London church at a Gaelic service, with organ accompaniment, by
a congregation of Gaels, Scots, Welsh, and <span class="nowrap">Angles!—</span></p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>The original book had decorative icons at the end of every chapter.
They were missing from Chapter I, IV and VII due to lack of printing
space in the book. These have been inserted in this ebook.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been 
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added,
when a predominant preference was found in the original book.</p>

<p>The titles Dr, Mr and Mrs sometimes had a period (Dr. Mr. and Mrs.);
this period has been removed for consistency. The abbreviation for
saint (St.) sometimes was missing the period; this has been added
for consistency.</p>

These variants have been left unchanged.</p>

<p>The Index has many entries misplaced alphabetically. The printed
